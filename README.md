=================================================

The project is broken into two separate GitHub repositories and Eclipse Java projects. This is the public repository for the shared project test code, input files, and expected output files.

Everyone will use the same tests repository, which may be updated over time by the instructor. You will not have write access to this repository. To make sure you have the latest version of this repository, perform a `git pull` operation before starting work on the project.
