PREFACE

This book was begun as a result of the author's experience in teaching
some classes in English in the night preparatory department of
the Carnegie Technical Schools of Pittsburg. The pupils in those
classes were all adults, and needed only such a course as would
enable them to express themselves in clear and correct English.
English Grammar, with them, was not to be preliminary to the grammar
of another language, and composition was not to be studied beyond
the everyday needs of the practical man.

Great difficulty was experienced because of inability to secure a
text that was suited to the needs of the class. A book was needed
that would be simple, direct and dignified; that would cover grammar,
and the essential principles of sentence structure, choice of words,
and general composition; that would deal particularly with the sources
of frequent error, and would omit the non-essential points; and,
finally that would contain an abundance of exercises and practical
work.

It is with these ends in view that this book has been prepared. The
parts devoted to grammar have followed a plan varying widely from
that of most grammars, and an effort has been made to secure a more
sensible and effective treatment. The parts devoted to composition
contain brief expositions of only the essential principles of ordinary
composition. Especial stress has been laid upon letter-writing,
since this is believed to be one of the most practical fields for
actual composition work. Because such a style seemed best suited to
the general scheme and purpose of the book, the method of treatment
has at times been intentionally rather formal.

Abundant and varied exercises have been incorporated at frequent
intervals throughout the text. So far as was practicable the exercises
have been kept constructive in their nature, and upon critical
points have been made very extensive.

The author claims little credit except for the plan of the book
and for the labor that he has expended in developing the details of
that plan and in devising the various exercises. In the statement
of principles and in the working out of details great originality
would have been as undesirable as it was impossible. Therefore,
for these details the author has drawn from the great common stores
of learning upon the subjects discussed. No doubt many traces of
the books that he has used in study and in teaching may be found
in this volume. He has, at times, consciously adapted matter from
other texts; but, for the most part, such slight borrowings as
may be discovered have been made wholly unconsciously. Among the
books to which he is aware of heavy literary obligations are the
following excellent texts: Lockwood and Emerson's Composition and
Rhetoric, Sherwin Cody's Errors in Composition, A. H. Espenshade's
Composition and Rhetoric, Edwin C. Woolley's Handbook of Composition,
McLean, Blaisdell and Morrow's Steps in English, Huber Gray Buehler's
Practical Exercises in English, and Carl C. Marshall's Business
English.

To Messrs. Ginn and Company, publishers of Lockwood and Emerson's
Composition and Rhetoric, and to the Goodyear-Marshall Publishing
Company, publishers of Marshall's Business English, the author is
indebted for their kind permission to make a rather free adaptation
of certain parts of their texts.

Not a little gratitude does the author owe to those of his friends
who have encouraged and aided him in the preparation of his manuscript,
and to the careful criticisms and suggestions made by those persons
who examined the completed manuscript in behalf of his publishers.
Above all, a great debt of gratitude is owed to Mr. Grant Norris,
Superintendent of Schools, Braddock, Pennsylvania, for the encouragement
and painstaking aid he has given both in preparation of the manuscript
and in reading the proof of the book.

CHAPTER I

SENTENCES.--PARTS OF SPEECH.--ELEMENTS OF THE SENTENCE.--PHRASES
AND CLAUSES

1. In thinking we arrange and associate ideas and objects together.
Words are the symbols of ideas or objects. A SENTENCE is a group
of words that expresses a single complete thought.

2. SENTENCES are of four kinds:

1. DECLARATIVE; a sentence that tells or declares something; as,
_That book is mine_.

2. IMPERATIVE; a sentence that expresses a command; as, _Bring me
that book_.

3. INTERROGATIVE; a sentence that asks a question; as, _Is that
book mine?_

4. EXCLAMATORY; a declarative, imperative, or interrogative sentence
that expresses violent emotion, such as terror, surprise, or anger;
as, _You shall take that book!_ or, _Can that book be mine?_

3. PARTS OF SPEECH. Words have different uses in sentences. According
to their uses, words are divided into classes called Parts of Speech.
The parts of speech are as follows:

1. NOUN; a word used as the name of something; as, _man, box,
Pittsburgh, Harry, silence, justice_.

2. PRONOUN; a word used instead of a noun; as, _I, he, it, that._

Nouns, pronouns, or groups of words that are used as nouns or pronouns,
are called by the general term, SUBSTANTIVES.

3. ADJECTIVE; a word used to limit or qualify the meaning of a noun
or a pronoun; as, _good, five, tall, many_.

The words _a, an_, and _the_ are words used to modify nouns or
pronouns. They are adjectives, but are usually called ARTICLES.

4. VERB; a word used to state something about some person or thing;
as, _do, see, think, make_.

5. ADVERB; a word used to modify the meaning of a verb, an adjective,
or another adverb; as, _very, slowly, clearly, often_.

6. PREPOSITION; a word used to join a substantive, as a modifier,
to some other preceding word, and to show the relation of the
substantive to that word; as, _by, in, between, beyond_.

7. CONJUNCTION; a word used to connect words, phrases, clauses,
and sentences; as, _and, but, if, although, or_.

8. INTERJECTION; a word used to express surprise or emotion; as,
_Oh! Alas! Hurrah! Bah!_

Sometimes a word adds nothing to the meaning of the sentence, but
helps to fill out its form or sound, and serves as a device to
alter its natural order. Such a word is called an EXPLETIVE. In
the following sentence _there_ is an expletive: _THERE are no such
books in print_.

4. A sentence is made up of distinct parts or elements. The essential
or PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS are the Subject and the Predicate.

The SUBJECT of a sentence is the part which mentions that about
which something is said. The PREDICATE is the part which states
that which is said about the subject. _Man walks_. In this sentence,
_man_ is the subject, and _walks_ is the predicate.

The subject may be simple or modified; that is, may consist of
the subject alone, or of the subject with its modifiers. The same
is true of the predicate. Thus, in the sentence, _Man walks_, there
is a simple subject and a simple predicate. In the sentence, _The
good man walks very rapidly_, there is a modified subject and a
modified predicate.

There may be, also, more than one subject connected with the same
predicate; as, _THE MAN AND THE WOMAN walk_. This is called a COMPOUND
SUBJECT. A COMPOUND PREDICATE consists of more than one predicate
used with the same subject; as, _The man BOTH WALKS AND RUNS_.

5. Besides the principal elements in a sentence, there are SUBORDINATE
ELEMENTS. These are the Attribute Complement, the Object Complement,
the Adjective Modifier, and the Adverbial Modifier.

Some verbs, to complete their sense, need to be followed by some
other word or group of words. These words which "complement," or
complete the meanings of verbs are called COMPLEMENTS.

The ATTRIBUTE COMPLEMENT completes the meaning of the verb by stating
some class, condition, or attribute of the subject; as, _My friend
is a STUDENT, I am WELL, The man is GOOD Student, well_, and _good_
complete the meanings of their respective verbs, by stating some
class, condition, or attribute of the subjects of the verbs.

The attribute complement usually follows the verb _be_ or its forms,
_is, are, was, will be_, etc. The attribute complement is usually a
noun, pronoun, or adjective, although it may be a phrase or clause
fulfilling the function of any of these parts of speech. It must
not be confused with an adverb or an adverbial modifier. In the
sentence, _He is THERE, there_ is an adverb, not an attribute
complement.

The verb used with an attribute complement, because such verb _joins_
the subject to its attribute, is called the COPULA ("to couple")
or COPULATIVE VERB.

Some verbs require an object to complete their meaning. This object
is called the OBJECT COMPLEMENT. In the sentence, _I carry a BOOK_,
the object, _book_, is required to complete the meaning of the
transitive verb _carry_; so, also in the sentences, _I hold the
HORSE_, and _I touch a DESK_, the objects _horse_ and _desk_ are
necessary to complete the meanings of their respective verbs. These
verbs that require objects to complete their meaning are called
Transitive Verbs.

ADJECTIVE and ADVERBIAL MODIFIERS may consist simply of adjectives
and adverbs, or of phrases and clauses used as adjectives or adverbs.

6. A PHRASE is a group of words that is used as a single part of
speech and that does not contain a subject and a predicate.

A PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE, always used as either an adjective or an
adverbial modifier, consists of a preposition with its object and
the modifiers of the object; as, _He lives IN PITTSBURG, Mr. Smith
OF THIS PLACE is the manager OF THE MILL, The letter is IN THE
NEAREST DESK_.

There are also Verb-phrases. A VERB-PHRASE is a phrase that serves
as a verb; as, _I AM COMING, He SHALL BE TOLD, He OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN TOLD_.

7. A CLAUSE is a group of words containing a subject and a predicate;
as, _The man THAT I SAW was tall_. The clause, _that I saw_, contains
both a subject, _I_, and a predicate, _saw_. This clause, since
it merely states something of minor importance in the sentence,
is called the SUBORDINATE CLAUSE. The PRINCIPAL CLAUSE, the one
making the most important assertion, is, _The man was tall_. Clauses
may be used as adjectives, as adverbs, and as nouns. A clause used
as a noun is called a SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSE. Examine the following
examples:

  Adjective Clause: The book _that I want_ is a history.
  Adverbial Clause: He came _when he had finished with the work_.
  Noun Clause as subject: _That I am here_ is true.
  Noun Clause as object: He said _that I was mistaken_.

8. Sentences, as to their composition, are classified as follows:

SIMPLE; a sentence consisting of a single statement; as, _The man
walks_.

COMPLEX; a sentence consisting of one principal clause and one or
more subordinate clauses; as, _The man that I saw is tall_.

COMPOUND; a sentence consisting of two or more clauses of equal
importance connected by conjunctions expressed or understood; as,
_The man is tall and walks rapidly_, and _Watch the little things;
they are important_.

EXERCISE I

_In this and in all following exercises, be able to give the reason
for everything you do and for every conclusion you reach. Only
intelligent and reasoning work is worth while.

In the following list of sentences:

(1) Determine the part of speech of every word.

(2) Determine the unmodified subject and the unmodified predicate;
and the modified subject and the modified predicate.

(3) Pick out every attribute complement and every object complement.

(4) Pick out every phrase and determine whether it is a prepositional
phrase or a verb-phrase. If it is a prepositional phrase, determine
whether it is used as an adjective or as an adverb.

(5) Determine the principal and the subordinate clauses. If they
are subordinate clauses, determine whether they are used as nouns,
adjectives, or adverbs.

CHAPTER II

NOUNS

9. A noun has been defined as a word used as the name of something.
It may be the name of a person, a place, a thing, or of some abstract
quality, such as, _justice_ or _truth_.

10. COMMON AND PROPER NOUNS. A PROPER NOUN is a noun that names
some particular or special place, person, people, or thing. A proper
noun should always begin with a capital letter; as, _English, Rome,
Jews, John_. A COMMON NOUN is a general or class name.

11. INFLECTION DEFINED. The variation in the forms of the different
parts of speech to show grammatical relation, is called INFLECTION.
Though there is some inflection in English, grammatical relation
is usually shown by position rather than by inflection.

The noun is inflected to show number, case, and gender.

12. NUMBER is that quality of a word which shows whether it refers
to one or to more than one. SINGULAR NUMBER refers to one. PLURAL
NUMBER refers to more than one.

13. PLURALS OF SINGULAR NOUNS ARE FORMED ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING
RULES:

1. Most nouns add _s_ to the singular; as, _boy, boys; stove, stoves_.

2. Nouns ending in _s, ch, sh_, or _x_, add _es_ to the singular;
as, _fox, foxes; wish, wishes; glass, glasses; coach, coaches_.

3. Nouns ending in _y_ preceded by a vowel (_a, e, i, o, u_) add
_s_; as, _valley, valleys_, (_soliloquy, soliloquies_ and _colloquy,
colloquies_ are exceptions). When _y_ is preceded by a consonant
(any letter other than a vowel), _y_ is changed to _i_ and _es_
is added; as, _army, armies; pony, ponies; sty, sties_.

4. Most nouns ending in _f_ or _fe_ add _s_, as, _scarf, scarfs;
safe, safes_. A few change _f_ or _fe_ to _v_ and add _es_; as,
_wife, wives; self, selves_. The others are: _beef, calf, elf,
half, leaf, loaf, sheaf, shelf, staff, thief, wharf, wolf, life_.
(_Wharf_ has also a plural, _wharfs_.)

5. Most nouns ending in _o_ add _s_; as, _cameo, cameos_. A number
of nouns ending in _o_ preceded by a consonant add _es_; as, _volcano,
volcanoes_. The most important of the latter class are: _buffalo,
cargo, calico, echo, embargo, flamingo, hero, motto, mulatto, negro,
potato, tomato, tornado, torpedo, veto_.

6. Letters, figures, characters, etc., add the apostrophe and _s_
(_'s_); as, _6's, c's, t's, that's_.

7. The following common words always form their plurals in an irregular
way; as, _man, men; ox, oxen; goose, geese; woman, women; foot,
feet; mouse, mice; child, children; tooth, teeth; louse, lice_.

COMPOUND NOUNS are those formed by the union of two words, either
two nouns or a noun joined to some descriptive word or phrase.

8. The principal noun of a compound noun, whether it precedes or
follows the descriptive part, is in most cases the noun that changes
in forming the plural; as, _mothers-in-law, knights-errant,
mouse-traps_. In a few compound words, both parts take a plural form;
as, _man-servant, men-servants; knight-templar, knights-templars_.

9. Proper names and titles generally form plurals in the same way
as do other nouns; as, _Senators Webster and Clay, the three Henrys_.
Abbreviations of titles are little used in the plural, except _Messrs._
(_Mr._), and _Drs._ (_Dr._).

10. In forming the plurals of proper names where a title is used,
either the title or the name may be put in the plural form. Sometimes
both are made plural; as, _Miss Brown, the Misses Brown, the Miss
Browns, the two Mrs. Browns_.

11. Some nouns are the same in both the singular and the plural;
as, _deer, series, means, gross_, etc.

12. Some nouns used in two senses have two plural forms. The most
important are the following:

BROTHER _brothers_ (by blood)       _brethren_ (by association)
CLOTH   _cloths_ (kinds of cloth)   _clothes_ (garments)
DIE     _dies_ (for coinage)        _dice_ (for games)
FISH    _fishes_ (separately)       _fish_ (collectively)
GENIUS  _geniuses_ (men of genius)  _genii_ (imaginary beings)
HEAD    _heads_ (of the body)       _head_ (of cattle)
INDEX   _indexes_ (of books)        _indices_ (in algebra)
PEA     _peas_ (separately)         _pease_ (collectively)
PENNY   _pennies_ (separately)      _pence_ (collectively)
SAIL    _sails_ (pieces of canvas)  _sail_ (number of vessels)
SHOT   _ shots_ (number of discharges) _shot_ (number of balls)

13. Nouns from foreign languages frequently retain in the plural
the form that they have in the language from which they are taken;
as, _focus, foci; terminus, termini; alumnus, alumni; datum, data;
stratum, strata; formula, formul; vortex, vortices; appendix,
appendices; crisis, crises; oasis, oases; axis, axes; phenomenon,
phenomena; automaton, automata; analysis, analyses; hypothesis,
hypotheses; medium, media; vertebra, vertebr; ellipsis, ellipses;
genus, genera; fungus, fungi; minimum, minima; thesis, theses_.

EXERCISE 3

_Write the plural, if any, of every singular noun in the following
list; and the singular, if any, of every plural noun. Note those
having no singular and those having no plural_.

News, goods, thanks, scissors, proceeds, puppy, studio, survey,
attorney, arch, belief, chief, charity, half, hero, negro, majority,
Mary, vortex, memento, joy, lily, knight-templar, knight-errant, why,
4, x, son-in-law, Miss Smith, Mr. Anderson, country-man, hanger-on,
major-general, oxen, geese, man-servant, brethren, strata, sheep,
mathematics, pride, money, pea, head, piano, veto, knives, ratios,
alumni, feet, wolves, president, sailor-boy, spoonful, rope-ladder,
grandmother, attorney-general, cupful, go-between.

_When in doubt respecting the form of any of the above, consult
an unabridged dictionary._

14. CASE. There are three cases in English: the Nominative, the
Possessive, and the Objective.

The NOMINATIVE CASE; the form used in address and as the subject
of a verb.

The OBJECTIVE CASE; the form used as the object of a verb or a
preposition. It is always the same in form as is the nominative.

Since no error in grammar can arise in the use of the nominative
or the objective cases of nouns, no further discussion of these
cases is here needed.

The POSSESSIVE CASE; the form used to show ownership. In the forming
of this case we have inflection.

15. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RULES FOR THE FORMING OF THE POSSESSIVE
CASE:

1. Most nouns form the possessive by adding the apostrophe and _s_
(_'s_); as, _man, man's; men, men's; pupil, pupil's; John, John's_.

2. Plural nouns ending in _s_ form the possessive by adding only
the apostrophe ('); as, _persons, persons'; writers, writers'_. In
stating possession in the plural, then one should say: _Carpenters'
tools sharpened here, Odd Fellows' wives are invited_, etc.

3. Some singular nouns ending in an _s_ sound form the possessive
by adding the apostrophe alone; as, _for appearance' sake, for
goodness' sake_. But usage inclines to the adding of the apostrophe
and _s_ (_'s_) even if the singular noun does end in an _s_ sound;
as, _Charles's book, Frances's dress, the mistress's dress_.

4. When a compound noun, or a group of words treated as one name,
is used to denote possession, the sign of the possessive is added
to the last word only; as, _Charles and John's mother_ (the mother
of both Charles and John), _Brown and Smith's store_ (the store
of the firm Brown & Smith).

5. Where the succession of possessives is unpleasant or confusing,
the substitution of a prepositional phrase should be made; as, _the
house of the mother of Charles's partner_, instead of, _Charles's
partner's mother's house_.

6. The sign of the possessive should be used with the word immediately
preceding the word naming the thing possessed; as, _Father and
mother's house, Smith, the lawyer's, office, The Senator from Utah's
seat_.

7. Generally, nouns representing inanimate objects should not be
used in the possessive case. It is better to say _the hands of
the clock_ than _the clock's hands_.

NOTE.--One should say _somebody else's_, not _somebody's else_.
The expression _somebody else_ always occurs in the one form, and
in such cases the sign of the possessive should be added to the
last word. Similarly, say, _no one else's, everybody else's_, etc.

EXERCISE 4

_Write the possessives of the following:_

Oxen, ox, brother-in-law, Miss Jones, goose, man, men, men-servants,
man-servant, Maine, dogs, attorneys-at-law, Jackson & Jones, John the
student, my friend John, coat, shoe, boy, boys, Mayor of Cleveland.

  3. They sell boy's hats and mens' coats.
  4. My friends' umbrella was stolen.

 15. The moons' face was hidden.
 16. Wine is made from the grape's juice.
 17. Morton, the principals, signature.
 18. Jones & Smith, the lawyers, office.

16. GENDER. Gender in grammar is the quality of nouns or pronouns
that denotes the sex of the person or thing represented. Those
nouns or pronouns meaning males are in the MASCULINE GENDER. Those
meaning females are in the FEMININE GENDER. Those referring to
things without sex are in the NEUTER GENDER.

In nouns gender is of little consequence. The only regular inflection
is the addition of the syllable-_ess_ to certain masculine nouns to
denote the change to the feminine gender; as, _author, authoress;
poet, poetess_. -I_x_ is also sometimes added for the same purpose;
as, _administrator, administratrix_.

The feminine forms were formerly much used, but their use is now
being discontinued, and the noun of masculine gender used to designate
both sexes.




CHAPTER III

PRONOUNS

17. PRONOUN AND ANTECEDENT. A PRONOUN is a word used instead of a
noun. The noun in whose stead it stands is called its ANTECEDENT.
_JOHN took Mary's BOOK and gave IT to HIS friend_. In this sentence
_book_ is the antecedent of the pronoun _it_, and _John_ is the
antecedent of _his_.

18. PRONOUNS SHOULD AGREE WITH THEIR ANTECEDENTS IN PERSON, GENDER,
AND NUMBER.

19. PERSONAL PRONOUNS are those that by their form indicate the
speaker, the person spoken to, or the person or thing spoken about.

Pronouns of the FIRST PERSON indicate the speaker; they are: _I,
me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours_.

Pronouns of the SECOND PERSON indicate the person or thing spoken
to; they are: _you, your, yours_. There are also the grave or solemn
forms in the second person, which are now little used; these are:
_thou, thee, thy, thine_, and _ye_.

Pronouns of the THIRD PERSON indicate the person or thing spoken
of; they are: _he, his, him, she, her, hers, they, their, theirs,
them, it, its_.

Few errors are made in the use of the proper person of the pronoun.

20. GENDER OF PRONOUNS. The following pronouns indicate sex or
gender; Masculine: _he, his, him_. Feminine: _she, her, hers_. Neuter:
_it, its_.

IN ORDER TO SECURE AGREEMENT IN GENDER IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THE
GENDER OF THE NOUN, EXPRESSED OR UNDERSTOOD, TO WHICH THE PRONOUN
REFERS. Gender of nouns is important only so far as it concerns
the use of pronouns. Study carefully the following rules in regard
to gender. These rules apply to the singular number only, since
all plurals of whatever gender are referred to by _they, their,
theirs_, etc.

THE FOLLOWING RULES GOVERN THE GENDER OF PRONOUNS:

MASCULINE; referred to by _HE, HIS_, and _HIM_:

1. Nouns denoting males are always masculine.

2. Nouns denoting things remarkable for strength, power, sublimity,
or size, when those things are regarded as if they were persons,
are masculine; _as, WINTER, with HIS chilly army, destroyed them
all_.

3. Singular nouns denoting persons of both sexes are masculine;
as, _EVERY ONE brought HIS umbrella_.

FEMININE; referred to by _SHE, HER_, or _HERS_:

1. Nouns denoting females are always feminine.

2. Nouns denoting objects remarkable for beauty, gentleness, and
peace, when spoken of as if they were persons, are feminine; as,
_SLEEP healed him with HER fostering care_.

NEUTER; referred to by _IT_ and _ITS_:

1. Nouns denoting objects without sex are neuter.

2. Nouns denoting objects whose sex is disregarded are neuter; as,
_IT is a pretty child, The WOLF is the most savage of ITS race_.

3. Collective nouns referring to a group of individuals as a unit
are neuter; as, _The JURY gives its VERDICT, The COMMITTEE makes
ITS report_.

An animal named may be regarded as masculine; feminine, or neuter,
according to the characteristics the writer fancies it to possess;
as, _The WOLF seeks HIS prey, The MOUSE nibbled HER way into the
box, The BIRD seeks ITS nest.

Certain nouns may be applied to persons of either sex. They are
then said to be of COMMON GENDER. There are no pronouns of common
gender; hence those nouns are referred to as follows:

1. By masculine pronouns when known to denote males; as, _MY CLASS-MATE_
(known to be Harry) _is taking HIS examinations_.

2. By feminine pronouns when known to denote females; as, _EACH
OF THE PUPILS of the Girls High School brought HER book._

3. By masculine pronouns when there is nothing in the connection
of the thought to show the sex of the object; as, _Let every PERSON
bring his book_.

21. NUMBER OF PRONOUNS. A more common source of error than disagreement
in gender is disagreement in number. _They, their, theirs_, and
_them_ are plural, but are often improperly used when only singular
pronouns should be used. The cause of the error is failure to realize
the true antecedent.

_If ANYBODY makes that statement, THEY are misinformed_. This sentence
is wrong. _Anybody_ refers to only one person; both _any_ and _body_,
the parts of the word, denote the singular. The sentence should read,
_If ANYBODY makes that statement, HE is misinformed. Similarly,
_Let EVERYBODY keep THEIR peace_, should read, _Let EVERYBODY keep
HIS peace.

22. COMPOUND ANTECEDENTS. Two or more antecedents connected by
_or_ or _nor_ are frequently referred to by the plural when the
singular should be used. _Neither John nor James brought THEIR
books_, should read, _Neither John nor James brought HIS books_.
When a pronoun has two or more singular antecedents connected by
_or_ or _nor_, the pronoun must be in the singular number; but
if one of the antecedents is plural, the pronoun must, also, be
in the plural; as, _Neither the Mormon nor his wives denied THEIR
religion_.

When a pronoun has two or more antecedents connected by _and_, the
pronoun must be in the plural number; as, _John and James brought
THEIR books_.

Further treatment of number will be given under verbs.

EXERCISE 9

_By what gender of the pronouns would you refer to the following
nouns?_

Snake, death, care, mercy, fox, bear, walrus, child, baby, friend
(uncertain sex), friend (known to be Mary), everybody, someone,
artist, flower, moon, sun, sorrow, fate, student, foreigner, Harvard
University, earth, Germany?

23. RELATIVE PRONOUNS. Relative Pronouns are pronouns used to introduce
adjective or noun clauses that are not interrogative. In the sentence,
_The man THAT I MENTIONED has come_, the relative clause, _that I
mentioned_, is an adjective clause modifying _man_. In the sentence,
_WHOM SHE MEANS, I do not know_, the relative clause is, _whom
she means_, and is a noun clause forming the object of the verb
_know_.

The relative pronouns are _who_ (_whose, whom_), _which, that_
and _what_. _But_ and _as_ are sometimes relative pronouns. There
are, also, compound relative pronouns, which will be mentioned
later.

24. _Who_ (with its possessive and objective forms, _whose_ and
_whom_) should be used when the antecedent denotes persons. When
the antecedent denotes things or animals, _which_ should be used.
_That_ may be used with antecedents denoting persons, animals or
things, and is the proper relative to use when the antecedent includes
both persons and things. _What_, when used as a relative, seldom
properly refers to persons. It always introduces a substantive
clause, and is equivalent to _that which_; as, _It is WHAT (that
which) he wants_.

25. _That_ is known as the RESTRICTIVE RELATIVE, because it should
be used whenever the relative clause limits the substantive, unless
_who_ or _which_ is of more pleasing sound in the sentence. In the
sentence, _He is the man THAT DID THE ACT_, the relative clause,
_that did the act_, defines what is meant by man; without the relative
clause the sentence clearly would be incomplete. Similarly, in
the sentence, _The book THAT I WANT is that red-backed history_,
the restrictive relative clause is, _that I want_, and limits the
application of _book_.

26. _Who_ and _which_ are known as the EXPLANATORY or NON-RESTRICTIVE
RELATIVES, and should be used ordinarily only to introduce relative
clauses which add some new thought to the author's principal thought.
_Spanish, WHICH IS THE LEAST COMPLEX LANGUAGE, is the easiest to
learn_. In this sentence the principal thought is, _Spanish is
the easiest language to learn_. The relative clause, _which is
the least complex language_, is a thought, which, though not fully
so important as the principal thought, is more nearly coördinate
than subordinate in its value. It adds an additional thought of
the speaker explaining the character of the Spanish language. When
_who_ and _which_ are thus used as explanatory relatives, we see
that the relative clause may be omitted without making the sentence
incomplete.

Compare the following sentences:

Explanatory relative clause: That book, _which is about history_,
has a red cover.

Restrictive relative clause: The book _that is about history_ has
a red cover.

Explanatory relative clause: Lincoln, _who was one of the world's
greatest men_, was killed by Booth.

Restrictive relative clause: The Lincoln _that was killed by Booth_
was one of the world's greatest men.

NOTE.--See §111, for rule as to the punctuation of relative clauses.

27. INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS. An Interrogative Pronoun is a pronoun
used to ask a question. The interrogative pronouns are, _who_ (_whose,
whom_), _which_, and _what_. In respect to antecedents, _who_ should
be used only in reference to persons; _which_ and _what_ may be
used with any antecedent, persons, animals, or things.

EXERCISE 10

_Choose the proper relative or interrogative pronoun to be inserted
in each of the following sentences. Insert commas where they are
needed._ (_See_ §111):

  1. The kindly physician ---- was so greatly loved is dead.
  2. This is the man ---- all are praising.
  3. John ---- is my coachman is sick.
  4. The intelligence ---- he displayed was remarkable.
  5. Intelligence ---- he had hitherto not manifested now showed its
     presence.
  6. He maintains that the book ---- you used is now ruined.
     (Does _which_ or _that_ have the more pleasing sound here?)
  7. The pleasure ---- education gives the man ---- has it is a
     sufficient reward for the trouble ---- it has cost.
  8. That man ---- wears a cap is a foreigner.
  9. The best hotel is the one ---- is nearest the station.

 31. It is the same song ---- he always sings.
 32. Such ---- I have is yours.
 33. All the men and horses ---- we had were lost.
 34. That is ---- pleased me most and ---- everyone talked about.
 35. The horse was one ---- I had never ridden before.
 36. That is ---- everyone said.

28. CASE FORMS OF PRONOUNS. Some personal, relative, and interrogative
pronouns have distinctive forms for the different cases, and the
failure to use the proper case forms in the sentence is one of
the most frequent sources of error. The case to be used is to be
determined by the use which the pronoun, not its antecedent, has
in the sentence. In the sentence, _I name HIM_, note that _him_
is the object of the verb _name_. In the sentence, _WHOM do you
seek_, although coming at the first of the sentence, _whom_ is
grammatically the object of the verb _seek_. In the use of pronouns
comes the most important need for a knowledge of when to use the
different cases.

Note the following different case forms of pronouns:

Nominative: _I, we, you, thou, ye, he, she, they, it, who_.

Objective: _me, us, you, thee, ye, him, her, it, them, whom_.

Possessive: _my, mine, our, ours, thy, thine, your, yours, his,
her, hers, its, their, theirs, whose_.

It will be noted that, while some forms are the same in both the
nominative and objective cases, _I, WE, HE, SHE, THEY, THOU_, AND
_WHO_ ARE ONLY PROPER WHERE THE NOMINATIVE CASE SHOULD BE USED.
_ME, US, HIM, THEM, THEE, WHOM_, AND _HER_, except when _her_ is
possessive, ARE ONLY PROPER WHEN THE OBJECTIVE CASE IS DEMANDED.
These forms must be remembered. It is only with these pronouns
that mistakes are made in the use of the nominative and objective
cases.

29. THE FOLLOWING OUTLINE EXPLAINS THE USE OF THE DIFFERENT CASE
FORMS OF THE PRONOUNS. The outline should be mastered.

THE NOMINATIVE CASE SHOULD BE USED:

1. When the noun or pronoun is the subject of a finite verb; that
is, a verb other than an infinitive. See 3 under Objective Case.

2. When it is an attribute complement. An attribute complement, as
explained in Chapter I, is a word used in the predicate explaining
or stating something about the subject. Examples: _It is I, The
man was HE, The people were THEY of whom we spoke._

3. When it is used without relation to any other part of speech,
as in direct address or exclamation.

THE OBJECTIVE CASE SHOULD BE USED:

1. When the noun or pronoun is the object of a verb; as, _He named
ME, She deceived THEM, They watch US_.

2. When it is the object of a preposition, expressed or understood:
as, _He spoke of ME, For WHOM do you take me, He told (to) ME a
story._

3. When it is the subject of an infinitive; as, _I told HIM to
go, I desire HER to hope_. The infinitives are the parts of the
verb preceded by _to_; as, _to go, to see, to be, to have been
seen_, etc. The sign of the infinitive, to, is not always expressed.
The objective case is, nevertheless, used; as, _Let HIM (to) go,
Have HER (to be) told about it._

4. When it is an attribute complement of an expressed subject of
the infinitive _to be_; as, _They believed her to be ME, He denied
it to have been him_. (See Note 2 below.)

THE POSSESSIVE CASE SHOULD BE USED:

When the word is used as a possessive modifier; as, _They spoke
of HER being present, The book is HIS (book), It is THEIR fault._

NOTE I.--When a substantive is placed by the side of another substantive
and is used to explain it, it is said to be in APPOSITION with that
other substantive and takes the case of that word; as, _It_ was
given _to John Smith, HIM whom you see there._

NOTE 2.--The attribute complement should always have the case of
that subject of the verb which is expressed in the sentence. Thus,
in the sentence, _I could not wish John to be HIM, him_ is properly
in the objective case, since there is an expressed subject of the
infinitive, _John_, which is in the objective case. But in the
sentence, _I should hate to be HE, he_ is properly in the nominative
case, since the only subject that is expressed in the sentence is
_I_, in the nominative case.

NOTE 3.--Where the relative pronoun _who (whom)_ is the subject of
a clause that itself is the object clause of a verb or a preposition,
it is always in the nominative case. Thus the following sentences are
both correct: _I delivered it to WHO owned it, Bring home WHOEVER
will come with you._

EXERCISE 11

_Write sentences illustrating the correct use of each of the following
pronouns:_

I, whom, who, we, me, us, they, whose, theirs, them, she, him, he,
its, mine, our, thee, thou.

30. The COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS are formed by adding _self_
or _selves_ to certain of the objective and possessive personal
pronouns; as, _herself, myself, itself, themselves_, etc. They
are used to add emphasis to an expression; as, _I, MYSELF, did
it, He, HIMSELF, said so._ They are also used reflexively after
verbs and prepositions; as, _He mentioned HIMSELF, He did it for
HIMSELF_.

The compound personal pronouns should generally be confined to
their emphatic and reflexive use. Do not say, _MYSELF and John
will come_, but, _John and I will come_. Do not say, _They invited
John and MYSELF_, but, _They invited John and ME_.

The compound personal pronouns have no possessive forms; but for
the sake of emphasis _own_ with the ordinary possessive form is
used; as, _I have my OWN book, Bring your OWN work, He has a home
of his OWN._

31. There are no such forms as _hisself, your'n, his'n, her'n,
theirself, theirselves, their'n_. In place of these use simply _his,
her, their_, or _your_.

EXERCISE 13

_Write sentences illustrating the correct use of the following simple
and compound personal pronouns:_

Myself, me, I, them, themselves, him, himself, her, herself, itself,

  9. The horse is to be for the use of ----.
 10. He said it to ----.
 11. He deceived ----.
 12. I do not wish ---- to be prominent.

32. The COMPOUND RELATIVE PRONOUNS are formed by adding _ever, so_,
or _soever_ to the relative pronouns, _who, which_, and _what_;
as, _whoever, whatever, whomever, whosoever, whoso, whosoever_,
etc. It will be noted that _whoever, whosoever_, and _whoso_ have
objective forms, _whomever, whomsoever_, and _whomso_; and possessive
forms, _whosoever, whosesoever_, and _whoseso_. These forms must
be used whenever the objective or possessive case is demanded.
Thus, one should say, _I will give it to WHOMEVER I find there_.
(See §29 and Note 3.)

EXERCISE 16

_Fill the following blanks with the proper forms of the compound
relatives:_

 21. ---- he says is worthy of attention.
 22. ---- she takes after, she is honest.
 23. ---- follows him will be sorry.
 24. ---- he may be, he is no gentleman.
 25. ---- they do is praised.

33. There are certain words, called ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS, which are
regarded as pronouns, because, although they are properly adjective
in their meaning, the nouns which they modify are never expressed;
as, _One_ (there is a possessive form, _one's_, and a plural form,
_ones_), _none, this, that, these, those, other, former, some,
few, many_, etc.

34. SOME MISCELLANEOUS CAUTIONS IN THE USE OF PRONOUNS:

1. The pronoun _I_ should always be capitalized, and should, when
used as part of a compound subject, be placed second; as, _James
and I were present, not I and James were present_.

2. Do not use the common and grave forms of the personal pronouns
in the same sentence; as, _THOU wilt do this whether YOU wish or
not_.

3. Avoid the use of personal pronouns where they are unnecessary;
as, _John, HE did it, or Mary, SHE said_. This is a frequent error
in speech.

4. Let the antecedent of each pronoun be clearly apparent. Note the
uncertainty in the following sentence; _He sent a box of cheese,
and IT was made of wood_. The antecedent of _it_ is not clear.
Again, _A man told his son to take HIS coat home_. The antecedent
of _his_ is very uncertain. Such errors are frequent.

In relative clauses this error may sometimes be avoided by placing
the relative clause as near as possible to the noun it limits.
Note the following sentence: _A cat was found in the YARD WHICH
wore a blue ribbon_. The grammatical inference would be that the
yard wore the blue ribbon. The sentence might be changed to, _A
CAT, WHICH wore a blue ribbon, was found in the yard_.

5. Relative clauses referring to the same thing require the same
relative pronoun to introduce them; as, _The book THAT we found
and the book THAT he lost are the same_.

6. Use _but that_ when _BUT_ is a conjunction and _that_ introduces
a noun clause; as, _There is no doubt BUT THAT he will go_. Use
_but what_ when _but_ is a preposition in the sense of _except_;
as, _He has no money but (except) WHAT I gave him_.

7. _Them_ is a pronoun and should never be used as an adjective.
_Those_ is the adjective which should be used in its place; as,
_Those people_, not, _Them people_.

8. Avoid using _you_ and _they_ indefinitely; as, _YOU seldom hear
of such things, THEY make chairs there_. Instead, say, _ONE seldom
hears of such things, Chairs are made there_.

9. _Which_ should not be used with a clause or phrase as its antecedent.
Both the following sentences are wrong: _He sent me to see John,
WHICH I did. Their whispering became very loud, which annoyed the
preacher_.

10. Never use an apostrophe with the possessive pronouns, _its,
yours, theirs, ours_ and _hers_.

_Correct the following sentences so that they do not violate the
cautions above stated_:

CHAPTER IV

ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS

35. An ADJECTIVE is a word used to modify a noun or a pronoun. An
ADVERB is a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another
adverb. Adjectives and adverbs are very closely related in both
their forms and their use.

36. COMPARISON. The variation of adjectives and adverbs to indicate
the degree of modification they express is called COMPARISON. There
are three degrees of comparison.

The POSITIVE DEGREE indicates the mere possession of a quality;
as, _true, good, sweet, fast, lovely_.

The COMPARATIVE DEGREE indicates a stronger degree of the quality
than the positive; as, _truer, sweeter, better, faster, lovelier_.

The SUPERLATIVE DEGREE indicates the highest degree of quality;
as, _truest, sweetest, best, fastest, loveliest_.

Where the adjectives and adverbs are compared by inflection they are
said to be compared regularly. In regular comparison the comparative
is formed by adding _er_, and the superlative by adding _est_. If
the word ends in _y_, the _y_ is changed to _i_ before adding the
ending; as, _pretty, prettier, prettiest_.

Where the adjectives and adverbs have two or more syllables, most
of them are compared by the use of the adverbs _more_ and _most_,
or, if the comparison be a descending one, by the use of _less_
and _least_; as, _beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful_, and
_less beautiful, least beautiful_.

37. Some adjectives and adverbs are compared by changing to entirely
different words in the comparative and superlative. Note the following:

POSITIVE                COMPARATIVE             SUPERLATIVE
bad, ill, evil, badly   worse                   worst
far                     farther, further        farthest, furthest
forth                   further                 furthest
fore                    former                  foremost, first
good, well              better                  best
hind                    hinder                  hindmost
late                    later, latter           latest, last
little                  less                    least
much, many              more                    most
old                     older, elder            oldest, eldest

NOTE.--_Badly_ and _forth_ may be used only as adverbs. _Well_
is usually an adverb; as, _He talks well_, but may be used as an
adjective; as, _He seems well_.

38. CONFUSION OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS. An adjective is often
used where an adverb is required, and vice versa. The sentence,
_She talks FOOLISH_, is wrong, because here the word to be modified
is _talks_, and since _talks_ is a verb, the adverb _foolishly_
should be used. The sentence, _She looks CHARMINGLY_, means, as
it stands, that her manner of looking at a thing is charming. What
is intended to be said is that she appears as if she was a charming
woman. To convey that meaning, the adjective, _charming_, should
have been used, and the sentence should read, _She looks charming_.
Wherever the word modifies a verb or an adjective or another adverb,
an adverb should be used, and wherever the word, whatever its location
in the sentence, modifies a noun or pronoun, an adjective should
be used.

39. The adjective and the adverb are sometimes alike in form. Thus,
both the following sentences are correct: _He works HARD_ (adverb),
and _His work is HARD_ (adjective). But, usually, where the adjective
and the adverb correspond at all, the adverb has the additional
ending _ly_; as, _The track is SMOOTH_, (adjective), and _The train
runs SMOOTHLY_, (adverb).

  RIGHT           WRONG
everywhere      everywheres
not nearly      nowhere near
not at all      not much or not muchly
ill             illy
first           firstly
thus            thusly
much            muchly
unknown         unbeknown
complexioned    complected

EXERCISE 21

_Correct the errors in the following sentences:_

  1. She goes everywheres.
  2. Hers is the most illy behaved child I know.
  3. Not muchly will I go.

  5. He is nowhere near so bright as John.
  6. You do the problem thusly.
  7. The causes are firstly, ignorance, and second, lack of energy.
  8. They came unbeknown to me.
  9. He is a dark complected man.
 10. It all happened unbeknownst to them.
 11. His vote was nowhere near so large as usual.

41. ERRORS IN COMPARISON are frequently made. Observe carefully
the following rules:

1. The superlative should not be used in comparing only two things.
One should say, _He is the LARGER of the two_, not _He is the LARGEST
of the two_. But, _He is the largest of the three_, is right.

2. A comparison should not be attempted by adjectives that express
absolute quality--adjectives that cannot be compared; as, _round,
perfect, equally, universal_. A thing may be _round_ or _perfect_,
but it cannot be _more round_ or _most round_, _more perfect_ or
_most perfect_.

3. When two objects are used in the comparative, one must not be
included in the other; but, when two objects are used in the
superlative, one must be included in the other. It is wrong to say,
_The discovery of America was MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY geographical
discovery_, for that is saying that the discovery of America was
more important than itself--an absurdity. But it would be right to
say, _The discovery of America was more important THAN ANY OTHER
geographical discovery_. One should not say, _He is the most honest
OF HIS fellow-workmen_, for he is not one of his fellow-workmen.
One should say, _He is more honest THAN ANY of his fellow-workmen_,
or, _He is the most honest OF ALL the workmen_. To say, _This machine
is BETTER THAN ANY machine_, is incorrect, but to say, _This machine
is better THAN ANY OTHER machine_, is correct. To say, _This machine
is the BEST OF ANY machine_ (or _any other machine_), is wrong,
because all machines are meant, not one machine or some machines.
To say, _This machine is the BEST OF machines_ (or _the best of
all machines_), is correct.

Note the following rules in regard to the use of _other_ in comparisons:

a. After comparatives followed by _than_ the words _any_ and _all_
should be followed by _other_.

b. After superlatives followed by _of, any_ and _other_ should not
be used.

4. Avoid mixed comparisons. _John is as good, if not better than
she_. If the clause, _if not better_, were left out, this sentence
would read, _John is as good than she_. It could be corrected to
read, _John is as good AS, if not better than she_. Similarly, it
is wrong to say, _He is one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
man in history_.

_Choose the correct word from those italicized:_

  1. The _older oldest_ of the three boys was sick.

 34. He is among the oldest if not the oldest of the men in the Senate.
 35. That picture is more beautiful than all the pictures.

42. SINGULAR AND PLURAL ADJECTIVES. Some adjectives can be used
only with singular nouns and some only with plural nouns. Such
adjectives as _one, each, every_, etc., can be used only with singular
nouns. Such adjectives as _several, various, many, sundry, two_,
etc., can be used only with plural nouns. In many cases, the noun
which the adjective modifies is omitted, and the adjective thus
acquires the force of a pronoun; as, _FEW are seen, SEVERAL have
come_.

The adjective pronouns _this_ and _that_ have plural forms, _these_
and _those_. The plurals must be used with plural nouns. To say
_those kind_ is then incorrect. It should be _those kinds_. _Those
sort of men_ should be _that sort of men_ or _those sorts of men_.

43. EITHER AND NEITHER are used to designate one of two objects
only. If more than two are referred to, use _any, none, any one,
no one_. Note the following correct sentences:

_NEITHER John nor Henry may go._

_ANY ONE of the three boys may go._

44. EACH OTHER should be used when referring to two; ONE ANOTHER
when referring to more than two. Note the following correct sentences:

_The two brothers love EACH OTHER._

_The four brothers love ONE ANOTHER._

EXERCISE 24

_Correct such of the following sentences as are incorrect. Be able
to give reasons:_

  1. He is six foot tall.
  2. I like those kind of fruit.
  3. He lost several pound.
  4. I have not seen him this twenty year.
  5. Have you heard these news?
  6. Are they those kind of people?
  7. He rode ten mile.
  8. There were fifteen car-load of people.
  9. These kind of books are interesting.
 10. Several phenomenon marked his character.
 11. There are a few crisis in every man's career.
 12. Each strata of the rock lies at an angle.
 13. The poem has six verse in it.
 14. Either of the five will do.
 15. Little children should love each other.
 16. Neither of the large cities in the United States is so large as
     London.
 17. You will be able to find it in either one of those three books.
 18. Those two brothers treat one another very coldly.
 19. Neither of the many newspapers published an account of it.
 20. Either law or medicine is his profession.
 21. Some ten box of shoes were on the train.
 22. Those two statements contradict one another.
 23. The Sahara Desert has several oasis.
 24. How can he associate with those sort of men?

45. PLACING OF ADVERBS AND ADJECTIVES. In the placing of adjective
elements and adverbial elements in the sentence, one should so
arrange them as to leave no doubt as to what they are intended to
modify.

Wrong: A man was riding on a _horse wearing gray trousers_.

Right: A _man wearing gray trousers_ was riding on a horse.

The adverb _only_ requires especial attention. Generally _only_
should come before the word it is intended to modify. Compare the
following correct sentences, and note the differences in meaning.

_Only_ he found the book.

He _only_ found the book.

He found _only_ the book.

He found the book _only_.

The placing of the words, _almost, ever, hardly, scarcely, merely_,
and _quite_, also requires care and thought.

EXERCISE 25

_Correct the errors in the location of adjectives and adverbs in
the following sentences:_

  1. I only paid five dollars.
  2. I have only done six problems.
  3. The clothing business is only profitable in large towns.
  4. The school is only open in the evening.
  5. I only need ten minutes in which to do it.
  6. He had almost climbed to the top when the ladder broke.
  7. I never expect to see the like again.
  8. A black base-ball player's suit was found.
  9. Do you ever remember to have seen the man before?
 10. The building was trimmed with granite carved corners.
 11. People ceased to wonder gradually.
 12. The captain only escaped by hiding in a ditch.
 13. I never wish to think of it again.
 14. On the trip in that direction he almost went to Philadelphia.
 15. Acetylene lamps are only used now in the country.
 16. He only spoke of history, not of art.
 17. I know hardly what to say.
 18. I was merely talking of grammar, not of English literature.
 19. The girls were nearly dressed in the same color.
 20. He merely wanted to see you.

46. DOUBLE NEGATIVES. _I am here_ is called an affirmative statement.
A denial of that, _I am not here_, is called a negative statement.
The words, _not, neither, never, none, nothing_, etc., are all
negative words; that is, they serve to make denials of statements.

Two negatives should never be used in the same sentence, since
the effect is then to deny the negative you wish to assert, and
an affirmative is made where a negative is intended. _We haven't
no books_, means that we have some books. The proper negative form
would be, _We have no books_, or _We haven't any books_. The mistake
occurs usually where such forms as _isn't, don't, haven't_, etc.,
are used. Examine the following sentences:

Wrong: _It isn't no_ use.

Wrong: There _don't none_ of them believe it.

Wrong: We _didn't_ do _nothing_.

_Hardly, scarcely, only_, and _but_ (in the sense of _only_) are
often incorrectly used with a negative. Compare the following right
and wrong forms:

Wrong: It was so dark that we _couldn't hardly_ see.

Right: It was so dark that we _could hardly_ see.

Wrong: There _wasn't only_ one person present.

Right: There _was only_ one person present.

 19. He can't hardly mean that.
 20. He isn't nowhere near so bright as I.
 21. He can't hardly come to-night.
 22. It is better to not think nothing about it.
 23. She can't only do that.
 24. There isn't no use of his objecting to it.
 25. There shan't none of them go along with us.
 26. Don't never do that again.
 27. We could not find but three specimens of the plant.
 28. He wasn't scarcely able to walk.
 29. He hasn't none of his work prepared.

47. THE ARTICLES. _A, an_, and _the_, are called Articles. _A_ and
_an_ are called the INDEFINITE ARTICLES, because they are used to
limit the noun to any one thing of a class; as, _a book, a chair_.
But _a_ or _an_ is not used to denote the whole of that class;
as, _Silence is golden_, or, _He was elected to the office of
President_.

_The_ is called the DEFINITE ARTICLE because it picks out some one
definite individual from a class.

In the sentence, _On the street are A brick and A stone house_,
the article is repeated before each adjective; the effect of this
repetition is to make the sentence mean two houses. But, in the
sentence, _On the street is A brick and stone house_, since the
article is used only before the first of the two adjectives, the
sentence means that there is only one house and that it is constructed
of brick and stone.

Where two nouns refer to the same object, the article need appear
only before the first of the two; as, _God, the author and creator
of the universe_. But where the nouns refer to two different objects,
regarded as distinct from each other, the article should appear
before each; as, _He bought a horse and a cow_.

_A_ is used before all words except those beginning with a vowel
sound. Before those beginning with a vowel sound _an_ is used.
If, in a succession of words, one of these forms could not be used
before all of the words, then the article must be repeated before
each. Thus, one should say, _AN ax, A saw, and AN adze_ (not _An
ax, saw and adze_), _made up his outfit_. Generally it is better
to repeat the article in each case, whether or not it be the same.

Do not say, _kind of A HOUSE_. Since _a house_ is singular, it
can have but one kind. Say instead, a _kind of house, a sort of
man_, etc.

EXERCISE 27

_Correct the following where you think correction is needed:_

  1. Where did you get that kind of a notion?
  2. She is an eager and an ambitious girl.
  3. He received the degree of a Master of Arts.
  4. The boy and girl came yesterday.
  5. Neither the man nor woman was here.
  6. He was accompanied by a large and small man.
  7. He planted an oak, maple and ash.
  8. The third of the team were hurt.
  9. The noun and verb will be discussed later.
 10. I read a Pittsburg and Philadelphia paper.
 11. Read the third and sixth sentence.
 12. Read the comments in a monthly and weekly periodical.
 13. He is dying from the typhoid fever.
 14. He was elected the secretary and the treasurer of the
     association.
 15. What sort of a student are you?
 16. He is a funny kind of a fellow.
 17. Bring me a new and old chair.
 18. That is a sort of a peculiar idea.
 19. He was operated upon for the appendicitis.
 20. Lock the cat and dog up.

48. No adverb necessary to the sense should be omitted from the
sentence. Such improper omission is frequently made when _very_ or
_too_ are used with past participles that are not also recognized
as adjectives; as,

Poor: I am _very insulted_. He was _too wrapped_ in thought to notice
the mistake.

Right: I am _very much insulted_. He was _too much wrapped_ in thought
to notice the mistake.

EXERCISE 28

only, but, finally, almost, ever, never, new, newly, very.




CHAPTER V

VERBS

49. A VERB has already been defined as a word stating something
about the subject. Verbs are inflected or changed to indicate the
time of the action as past, present, or future; as, _I talk, I
talked, I shall talk_, etc. Verbs also vary to indicate completed
or incompleted action; as, _I have talked, I shall have talked_,
etc. To these variations, which indicate the time of the action,
the name TENSE is given.

The full verbal statement may consist of several words; as, _He
MAY HAVE GONE home_. Here the verb is _may have gone_. The last
word of such a verb phrase is called the PRINCIPAL VERB, and the
other words the AUXILIARIES. In the sentence above, _go (gone)_
is the principal verb, and _may_ and _have_ are the auxiliaries.

50. In constructing the full form of the verb or verb phrase there
are three distinct parts from which all other forms are made. These
are called the PRINCIPAL PARTS.

The First Principal Part, since it is the part by which the verb is
referred to as a word, may be called the NAME-FORM. The following
are name-forms: _do, see, come, walk, pass_.

The Second Principal Part is called the PAST TENSE. It is formed
by adding _ed_ to the name-form; as, _walked, pushed, passed_.
These verbs that add _ed_ are called Regular Verbs. The verb form
is often entirely changed; as, _done (do), saw (see), came (come)_.
These verbs are called Irregular Verbs.

The Third Principal Part is called the PAST PARTICIPLE. It is used
mainly in expressing completed action or in the passive voice.
In regular verbs the past participle is the same in form as the
past tense. In irregular verbs it may differ entirely from both
the name-form and the past tense, or it may resemble one or both
of them. Examples: _done (do, did), seen (see, saw), come (come,
came), set (set, set)_.

51. THE NAME-FORM, when unaccompanied by auxiliaries, is used with
all subjects, except those in the third person singular, to assert
action in the present time or present tense; as, _I go, We come,
You see, Horses run_.

The name-form is also used with various auxiliaries (_may, might,
can, must, will, should, shall_, etc.) to assert futurity,
determination, possibility, possession, etc. Examples: _I may go,
We shall come, You can see, Horses should run_.

By preceding it with the word _to_, the name-form is used to form
what is called the PRESENT INFINITIVE; as, _I wish to go, I hope
to see_.

What may be called the S-FORM of the verb, or the SINGULAR form,
is usually constructed by adding _s_ or _es_ to the name-form.
The s-form is used with singular subjects in the third person; as,
_He goes, She comes, It runs, The dog trots_.

The s-form is found in the third personal singular of the present
tense. In other tenses, if present at all, the s-form is in the
auxiliary, where the present tense of the auxiliary is used to
form some other tense of the principal verb. Examples: _He has_
(present tense), _He has gone_ (perfect tense), _He has been seen_.

Some verbs have no s-form; as, _will, shall, may_. The verb _be_
has two irregular s-forms: _Is_, in the present tense, and _was_
in the past tense. The s-form of _have_ is _has_.

52. The past tense always stands alone in the predicate; i. e., IT
SHOULD NEVER BE USED WITH ANY AUXILIARIES. To use it so, however,
is one of the most frequent errors in grammar. The following are
past tense forms: _went, saw, wore, tore_. To say, therefore, _I
have saw, I have went, It was tore, They were wore_, would be grossly
incorrect.

53. The third principal part, the past participle, on the other
hand, CAN NEVER BE USED AS A PREDICATE VERB WITHOUT AN AUXILIARY.
The following are distinctly past participle forms: _done, seen,
sung_, etc. One could not then properly say, _I seen, I done, I
sung_, etc.

The distinction as to use with and without auxiliaries applies, of
course, only to irregular verbs. In regular verbs, the past tense
and past participle are always the same, and so no error could
result from their confusion.

The past participle is used to form the _Perfect Infinitives_; as,
_to have gone, to have seen, to have been seen_.

54. The following is a list of the principal parts of the most
important irregular verbs. The list should be mastered thoroughly.
The student should bear in mind always that, THE PAST TENSE FORM
SHOULD NEVER BE USED WITH AN AUXILIARY, and that THE PAST PARTICIPLE
FORM SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS A PREDICATE VERB WITHOUT AN AUXILIARY.

In some instances verbs have been included in the list below which
are always regular in their forms, or which have both regular and
irregular forms. These are verbs for whose principal parts incorrect
forms are often used.

write                       wrote                       written

NOTES.--_Ought_ has no past participle. It may then never be used
with an auxiliary. _I had ought to go_ is incorrect. The idea would
be amply expressed by _I ought to go_.

55. TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS. A TRANSITIVE VERB is one
in which the action of the verb goes over to a receiver; as, _He
KILLED the horse, I KEEP my word_. In both these sentences, the
verb serves to transfer the action from the subject to the object
or receiver of the action. The verbs in these sentences, and all
similar verbs, are transitive verbs. All others, in which the action
does not go to a receiver, are called INTRANSITIVE VERBS.

56. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE. The ACTIVE VOICE represents the subject
as the doer of the action; as, _I tell, I see, He makes chairs_.
The PASSIVE VOICE represents the subject as the receiver of the
action; as, _I am told, I am seen, I have been seen, Chairs are
made by me_. Since only transitive verbs can have a receiver of
the action, only transitive verbs can have both active and passive
voice.

57. There are a few special verbs in which the failure to distinguish
between the transitive and the intransitive verbs leads to frequent
error. The most important of these verbs are the following: _sit,
set, awake, wake, lie, lay, rise, arise, raise, fell_, and _fall_.
Note again the principal parts of these verbs:

wake (to rouse another)     woke, waked     woke, waked
awake (to cease to sleep)   awoke, awaked   awaked

fell (to strike down)       felled          felled
fall (to topple over)       fell            fallen

lay (to place)              laid            laid
lie (to recline)            lay             lain

raise (to cause to ascend)  raised          raised
(a)rise (to ascend)         (a)rose         (a)risen

set (to place)              set             set
sit (to rest)               sat             sat

The first of each pair of the above verbs is transitive, and the
second is intransitive. Only the first, then, of each pair can
have an object or can be used in the passive voice.

NOTES.--The following exceptions in the use of _sit_ and _set_
are, by reason of usage, regarded as correct: _The sun sets, The
moon sets, They sat themselves down to rest_, and _He set out for
Chicago_.

_Lie_, meaning to deceive, has for its principal parts, _lie, lied,
lied. Lie_, however, with this meaning is seldom confused with _lie_
meaning to recline. The present participle of _lie_ is _lying_.

Compare the following sentences, and note the reasons why the second
form in each case is the correct form.

WRONG                              RIGHT
Awake me early to-morrow.          Wake me early to-morrow.

58. MODE. Mode is that form of the verb which indicates the manner
in which the action or state is to be regarded. There are several
modes in English, but only between the indicative and subjunctive
modes is the distinction important. Generally speaking, the INDICATIVE
MODE is used when the statement is regarded as a fact or as truth,
and the SUBJUNCTIVE MODE is used when the statement expresses
uncertainty or implies some degree of doubt.

59. FORMS OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE. The places in which the subjunctive
differs from the indicative are in the present and past tenses
of the verb _be_, and in the present tense of active verbs. The
following outline will show the difference between the indicative
and the subjunctive of _be_:

INDICATIVE PRESENT OF BE         INDICATIVE PAST OF BE
I am                we are       I was                we were
thou art            you are      thou wert or wast    you were
he (she, it) is     they are     he (she, it) was     they were

SUBJUNCTIVE PRESENT OF BE        SUBJUNCTIVE PAST OF BE
If I be             If we be     If I were            If we were
If thou be          If you be    If thou were         If you were
If he (she, it) be  If they be   If he (she, it) were If they were

_If_ is used only as an example of the conjunctions on which the
subjunctive depends. Other conjunctions may be used, or the verb
may precede the subject.

NOTE.--It will be noticed that _thou art_ and _thou wast_, etc.,
have been used in the second person singular. Strictly speaking,
these are the proper forms to be used here, even though _you are_
and _you were_, etc., are customarily used in addressing a single
person.

In the subjunctive of _be_, it will be noted that the form _be_ is
used throughout the present tense; and the form _were_ throughout
the past tense.

In other verbs the subjunctive, instead of having the s-form in
the third person singular of the present tense, has the name-form,
or the same form as all the other forms of the present tense; as,
indicative, _he runs, she sees, it seems, he has;_ subjunctive,
_if he run, though she see, lest it seem, if he have_.

NOTE.--An examination of the model conjugations under §77 will give
a further understanding of the forms of the subjunctive.

60. USE OF INDICATIVE AND SUBJUNCTIVE. The indicative mode would
be properly used in the following sentence, when the statement is
regarded as true: _If that evidence is true, then he is a criminal_.
Similarly: _If he is rich, he ought to be charitable_. Most directly
declarative statements are put in the indicative mode.

But when the sense of the statement shows uncertainty in the speaker's
mind, or shows that the condition stated is regarded as contrary to
fact or as untrue, the subjunctive is used. Note the two sentences
following, in which the conditions are properly in the subjunctive:
_If those statements be true, then all statements are true, Were
I rich, I might be charitable_.

The subjunctive is usually preceded by the conjunctions, _if, though,
lest, although_, or the verb precedes the subject. But it must be
borne in mind that these do not always indicate the subjunctive
mode. THE USE OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONDITION
IS REGARDED AS A FACT OR AS CONTRARY TO FACT, CERTAIN OR UNCERTAIN.

It should be added that the subjunctive is perhaps going out of
use; some of the best writers no longer use its forms. This passing
of the subjunctive is to be regretted and to be discouraged, since
its forms give opportunity for many fine shades of meaning.

61. AGREEMENT OF VERB WITH ITS SUBJECT. THE VERB SHOULD AGREE WITH
ITS SUBJECT IN PERSON AND NUMBER. The most frequent error is the
failure of the verb to agree in number with its subject. Singular
subjects are used with plural verbs, and plural subjects with singular
verbs. These errors arise chiefly from a misapprehension of the
true number of the subject.

The s-form of the verb is the only distinct singular form, and
occurs only in the third person, singular, present indicative;
as, _He runs, she goes, it moves_. _Is, was_, and _has_ are the
singular forms of the auxiliaries. _Am_ is used only with a subject
in the first person, and is not a source of confusion. The other
auxiliaries have no singular forms.

Failure of the verb and its subject to agree in person seldom occurs,
and so can cause little confusion.

Examine the following correct forms of agreement of verb and subject:

A barrel of clothes WAS shipped (not _were shipped_).

A man and a woman HAVE been here (not _has been here_).

Boxes ARE scarce (not _is scarce_).

When WERE the brothers here (not _when was_)?

62. AGREEMENT OF SUBJECT AND VERB IN NUMBER. The general rule to
be borne in mind in regard to number, is that IT IS THE MEANING
AND NOT THE FORM OF THE SUBJECT THAT DETERMINES WHETHER TO USE THE
SINGULAR OR THE PLURAL FORM OF THE VERB. This rule also applies
to the use of singular or plural pronouns.

Many nouns plural in form are singular in meaning; as, _politics,
measles, news_, etc.

Many, also, are treated as plurals, though in meaning they are singular;
as, _forceps, tongs, trousers_.

Some nouns, singular in form, are, according to the sense in which,
they are used, either singular or plural in meaning; as, _committee,
family, pair, jury, assembly, means_. The following sentences are
all correct: _The assembly has closed its meeting, The assembly
are all total abstainers, The whole family is a famous one, The
whole family are sick_.

In the use of the adjective pronouns, _some, each_, etc., the noun
is often omitted. When this is done, error is often made by using
the wrong number of the verb. _Each, either, neither, this, that_,
and _one_, when used alone as subjects, require singular verbs.
_All, those, these, few, many_, always require plural verbs. _Any,
none_, and _some_ may take either singular or plural verbs. In most
of these cases, as is true throughout the subject of agreement in
number, reason will determine the form to be used.

Some nouns in a plural form express quantity rather than number.
When quantity is plainly intended the singular verb should be used.
Examine the following sentences; each is correct: _Three drops of
medicine is a dose, Ten thousand tons of coal was purchased by
the firm, Two hundred dollars was the amount of the collection,
Two hundred silver dollars were in the collection_.

EXERCISE 41

_Go over each of the above sentences and determine whether IT or
THEY should be used in referring to the subject._

63. THE FOLLOWING RULES GOVERN THE AGREEMENT OF THE VERB WITH A
COMPOUND SUBJECT:

1. When a singular noun is modified by two adjectives so as to
mean two distinct things, the verb should be in the plural; as,
_French and German literature ARE studied._

2. When the verb applies to the different parts of the compound
subject, the plural form of the verb should be used; as, _John
and Harry ARE still to come._

3. When the verb applies to one subject and not to the others,
it should agree with that subject to which it applies; as, _The
employee, and not the employers, WAS to blame, The employers, and
not the employee, WERE to blame, The boy, as well as his sisters,
DESERVES praise._

4. When the verb applies separately to several subjects, each in
the singular, the verb should be singular; as, _Each book and each
paper WAS in its place, No help and no hope IS found for him, Either
one or the other IS he, Neither one nor the other IS he._

5. When the verb applies separately to several subjects, some of
which are singular and some plural, it should agree with the subject
nearest to it; as, _Neither the boy, nor his sisters DESERVE praise,
Neither the sisters nor the boy DESERVES praise._

6. When a verb separates its subjects, it should agree with the
first; as, _The leader WAS slain and all his men, The men WERE
slain, and also the leader._

_Choose the proper form of the verb in the following sentences:_

 42. Brain power, as well as money, _talk talks_.
 43. Each boy and girl _bring brings_ books.

64. SOME MISCELLANEOUS CAUTIONS IN REGARD TO AGREEMENT IN NUMBER:

1. Do not use a plural verb after a singular subject modified by an
adjective phrase; as, _The thief, with all his booty, was captured_.

2. Do not use a singular form of the verb after _you_ and _they_.
Say: _You were, they are, they were_, etc., not, _you was, they
was,_ etc.

3. Do not mistake a noun modifier for the noun subject. In the
sentence, _The SALE of boxes was increased, sale_, not _boxes_,
is the subject of the verb.

4. When the subject is a relative pronoun, the number and the person
of the antecedent determine the number and the person of the verb.
Both of the following sentences are correct: _He is the only one
of the men THAT IS to be trusted, He is one of those men THAT ARE
to be trusted._ It is to be remembered that the singulars and the
plurals of the relative pronouns are alike in form; _that, who_,
etc., may refer to one or more than one.

5. Do not use incorrect contractions of the verb with _not_. _Don't_
cannot be used with _he_ or _she_ or _it_, or with any other singular
subject in the third person. One should say, _He doesn't_, not _he
don't; it doesn't_, not _it don't; man doesn't_, not _man don't_. The
proper form of the verb that is being contracted in these instances
is _does_, not _do_. _Ain't_ and _hain't_ are always wrong; no
such contractions are recognized. Such colloquial contractions
as _don't, can't_, etc., should not be used at all in formal
composition.

65. USE OF SHALL AND WILL. The use of the auxiliaries, _shall_ and
_will_, with their past tenses, is a source of very many errors.
The following outline will show the correct use of _shall_ and
_will_, except in dependent clauses and questions:

To indicate simple futurity or probability:

  Use _shall_ with _I_ and _we_; use _will_ with
  all other subjects.

To indicate promise, determination, threat, or command on the part
of the speaker; i. e., action which the speaker means to control;

  Use _will_ with _I_ and _we_; use _shall_ with
  all other subjects.

Examine the following examples of the correct use of _shall_ and
_will_:

Statements as to probable future events:

  _We shall_ probably be there.
  I think _you will_ want to be there.
  _It will_ rain before night.

Statements of determination on the part of the speaker:

  _I will_ come in spite of his command.
  _You shall_ go home.
  _It shall_ not happen again, I promise you.

66. SHALL AND WILL IN QUESTIONS. In interrogative sentences _shall_
should always be used with the first person. In the second and third
persons that auxiliary should be used which is logically expected
in the answer.

Examine the agreement in the use of _shall_ and _will_ in the following
questions and answers:

  QUESTIONS.                        ANSWERS.
_Shall_ I miss the car?             You _will_ miss it.
_Shall_ you be there?               I think I _shall_ (probability).
_Will_ he do it?                    I think he _will_ (assertion).
_Shall_ your son obey the teacher?  He _shall_ (determination).
_Will_ you promise to come?         We _will_ come (promise).

67. SHALL AND WILL IN DEPENDENT CLAUSES. In dependent clauses which
are introduced by _that_, expressed or understood, the auxiliary
should be used which would be proper if the dependent clause were
a principal clause. The sentence, _They assure us that they SHALL
come_, is wrong. The direct assurance would be, _We WILL come_.
The auxiliary, then, in a principal clause would be _will_. _Will_
should, therefore, be the auxiliary in the dependent construction,
and the sentence should read, _They assure us that they WILL come_.
Further examples:

  I suppose _we shall_ have to pay.
  He thinks that _you will_ be able to do it.
  He has decided that _John shall_ replace the book.

In all dependent clauses expressing a condition or contingency use
_shall_ with all subjects. Examples;

  _If he shall_ go to Europe, it will be his tenth trip abroad.
  _If you shall_ go away, who will run the farm?
  _If I shall_ die, I shall die as an honest man.

EXERCISE 45

_Justify the correct use of SHALL and WILL in the following sentences:_

  1. I will go if you wish.
  2. I shall probably go if you wish.

_Write five sentences in which SHALL is used in an independent
clause, and five in which SHALL is used in a dependent clause._

_Write five sentences in which WILL is used in an independent clause,
and five in which WILL is used in a dependent clause._

_Write five interrogative sentences in which SHALL is used and five
in which WILL is used._

68. SHOULD AND WOULD. _Should_ and _would_ are the past tenses
of _shall_ and _will_, and have corresponding uses. _Should_ is
used with _I_ and _we_, and _would_ with other subjects, to express
mere futurity or probability. _Would_ is used with _I_ and _we_,
and _should_ with other subjects, to express conditional promise
or determination on the part of the speaker. Examples:

Futurity:

  I _should_ be sorry to lose this book.
  If we _should_ be afraid of the storm, we _should_ be foolish.
  It was expected that they _would_ be here.

Volition or determination:

  If it _should_ occur, we _would_ not come.
  It was promised that it _should_ not occur again.
  He decided that it _should_ be done.

_Should_ is sometimes used in the sense of _ought_, to imply duty;
as, _He should have gone to her aid_.

_Would_ is often used to indicate habitual action; as, _This would
often occur when he was preaching_.

70. PARTICIPLES AND GERUNDS. The past participle has already been
mentioned as one of the principal parts of the verb. Generally, the
PARTICIPLES are those forms of the verb that ARE USED ADJECTIVELY;
as, _seeing, having seen, being seen, having been seen, seen, playing,
having played_, etc. In the following sentences note that the verb
form in each case modifies a substantive: _He, HAVING BEEN INVITED
TO DINE, came early, John, BEING SICK, could not come_. The verb
form in all these cases is called a participle, and must be used
in connection with either a nominative or objective case of a noun
or pronoun.

The GERUND is the same as the participle in its forms, but differs
in that, while the participle is always used adjectively, the GERUND
IS ALWAYS USED SUBSTANTIVELY; as, _I told OF HIS WINNING the race,
AFTER HIS ASSERTING it, I believe the statement_.

71. MISUSES OF PARTICIPLES AND GERUNDS.

1. A participle should not be used unless it stands in a grammatical
and logical relation to some substantive that is present in the
sentence. Failure to follow this rule leads to the error known
as the "dangling participle." It is wrong to say, _The dish was
broken, RESULTING from its fall_, because _resulting_ does not
stand in grammatical relation to any word in the sentence. But
it would be right to say, _The dish was broken as a result of its
fall_. Examine, also, the following examples:

Wrong: I spent a week in Virginia, _followed_ by a week at Atlantic
City.

Right: I spent a week in Virginia, _following_ it by a week at Atlantic
City.

Right: I spent a week in Virginia, _and then_ a week at Atlantic
City.

2. A participle should not stand at the beginning of a sentence or
principal clause unless it belongs to the subject of that sentence
or clause. Compare the following:

Wrong: Having been sick, it was decided to remain at home.

Right: Having been sick, I decided to remain at home.

3. A participle preceded by _thus_ should not be used unless it
modifies the subject of the preceding verb. Compare the following:

Wrong: He had to rewrite several pages, _thus causing_ him a great
deal of trouble.

Right: He had to rewrite several pages, _and was thus caused_ a
great deal of trouble.

Right: He had to rewrite several pages, _thus experiencing_ a great
deal of trouble.

4. The gerund is often used as the object of a preposition, and
frequently has a noun or pronoun modifier. Owing to confusion between
the gerund and the participle, and to the failure to realize that
the gerund can only be used substantively, the objective case of a
modifying noun or pronoun is often wrongly used before the gerund.
A substantive used with the gerund should always be in the possessive
case. Say, _I heard OF JOHN'S COMING_, not, _I heard OF JOHN COMING_.

5. When a gerund and a preposition are used, the phrase should
be in logical and immediate connection with the substantive it
modifies, and the phrase should never introduce a sentence unless
it logically belongs to the subject of that sentence. Exception:
When the gerund phrase denotes a general action, it may be used
without grammatical connection to the sentence; as, _In traveling,
good drinking water is essential_. Compare the following wrong
and right forms:

Wrong: _After seeing his mistake_, a new start was made.

Right: _After seeing his mistake_, he made a new start.

Wrong: _By writing rapidly, the work_ can be finished.

Right: _By writing rapidly, you_ can finish the work.

Wrong: _In copying the exercise_, a mistake was made.

Right: _In copying the exercise, I_ made a mistake.

sentences, correct the sentences so as to avoid such impropriety.
See §107 for rule as to punctuation:_

  1. Having assented to your plan, you try to hold me responsible.
  2. He asked him to make the plans, owing to the need of an experienced
     architect.
  3. It was decided to send his son abroad being anxious for his health.
  4. On hearing that, a new plan was made.
  5. Moving slowly past our window, we saw a great load of lumber.
  6. Intending to go to the theater, the whole afternoon was spent in
     town.
  7. He was taken into the firm, thus gaining an increased income.
  8. Not having the lesson prepared, he told John to stay after class.
  9. No letter was written for more than a week, causing considerable
     anxiety.
 10. Expecting us to come, we disappointed him.
 11. After telling me the story, I left him.
 12. By reading aloud to the class, they do not gain much.
 13. He had to wait several hours for the train, thus causing him to
     lose a great deal of valuable time.
 14. After listening to his lecture for an hour he became tiresome.
 15. We listened attentively to his lecture, thus showing our interest.

72. INFINITIVES. The Infinitives are formed by the word _to_ and
some part of the verb or of the verb and auxiliary. For _see_ and
_play_ as model verbs, the infinitives are as follows:

PRESENT ACTIVE            PRESENT PASSIVE
  to see                    to be seen
  to play                   to be played

PRESENT PERFECT ACTIVE    PRESENT PERFECT PASSIVE
  to have seen              to have been seen
  to have played            to have been played

The word _to_ is frequently omitted. In general, other verbs follow
the same endings and forms as do the infinitives above.

It is necessary to know the difference between the two tenses, since
the misuse of tenses leads to a certain class of errors.

73. SEQUENCE OF INFINITIVE TENSES. The wrong tense of the infinitive
is frequently used. The following rules should be observed:

1. If the action referred to by the infinitive is of the same time
or of later time than that indicated by the predicate verb, the
PRESENT INFINITIVE should be used.

2. When the action referred to by the infinitive is regarded as
completed at the time indicated by the predicate verb, the PERFECT
INFINITIVE should be used.

Examine the following examples:

Wrong: _I should have liked to have gone._

Right: _I should have liked to go_ (same or later time).

Right: _I should like to have gone_ (earlier time).

Wrong: _It was bad to have been discovered._

Right: _It is bad to have been discovered_ (earlier time).

Right: _It was bad to be discovered_ (same or later time).

Right: _She did not believe her son to have committed the crime_
(earlier time).

Right: _When he died, he believed himself to have been defeated
for the office_ (earlier time.)

  3. The game was intended _to be played to have been played_
     yesterday.

     than any other war.

 16. It would have been hard _to accomplish to have accomplished_
     that result.
 17. He was foolish enough _to have spoiled to spoil_ six negatives.
 18. I wanted _to have attended to attend_ the convention.
 19. It would be terrible _to be lost to have been lost_ in the forest.
 20. We were asked _to have waited to wait_.
 21. I am eager _to have seen to see it_.
 22. I am pleased _to meet to have met_ you.

74. SPLIT INFINITIVES. In the sentence, care should be taken to
avoid as much as possible the inserting of an adverb or an adverbial
modifier between the parts of the infinitive. This error is called
the "split infinitive." Compare the following:

Bad: He seemed _to easily learn_.
Good: He seemed _to learn easily_.

Bad: He is said _to have rapidly run_ along the street.
Good: He is said _to have run rapidly_ along the street.

EXERCISE 55

  5. The plan was to secretly destroy the documents.
  6. His policy was to never offend.
  7. He wished to in this way gain friends.
  8. He proposed to greatly decrease his son's allowance.

75. AGREEMENT OF VERB IN CLAUSES. In a compound predicate, the
parts of the predicate should agree in tense; PAST TENSE SHOULD
FOLLOW PAST TENSE, AND PERFECT TENSE FOLLOW PERFECT TENSE. Examine
the following:

Wrong: He _has tried_ to do, and really _did_ everything possible
to stop his son.

Right: He _has tried_ to do, and really _has done_ everything possible
to stop his son.

Right: He _tried_ to do, and really _did_ everything possible to
stop his son.

Wrong: I _hoped_ and _have worked_ to gain this recognition.

Right: I _hoped_ and _worked_ to gain this recognition.

Right: I _have hoped_ and _have worked_ to gain this recognition.

 10. I have believed and usually taught that theory.
 11. I intended to and have endeavored to finish the work.

     as I.
 13. He has gained the favor of the king and was sent to Italy.
 14. We have needed you and did our best to find you.

76. OMISSION OF THE VERB OR PARTS OF THE VERB. The verb or some
of its parts are often omitted. This omission sometimes makes the
sentence ungrammatical or doubtful in its meaning.

_I like him better than John_. This sentence may have the meaning
shown in either of its following corrected forms: _I like him better
than John DOES_, or _I like him better than I LIKE John_.

As a matter of good usage, the verb or any other part of speech
should be repeated wherever its omission either makes the sentence
ambiguous or gives it an incomplete sound.

Bad: _He was told to go where he ought not_.
Good: _He was told to go where he ought not to go_.
Good: _He was told to go where he should not go_.

EXERCISE 57

_Correct the following sentences:_

  1. I admire Mary more than John.

CHAPTER VI

CONNECTIVES: RELATIVE PRONOUNS, RELATIVE ADVERBS, CONJUNCTIONS,
AND PREPOSITIONS

78. INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT CLAUSES. A sentence may consist of
two or more independent clauses, or it may consist of one principal
clause and one or more dependent clauses.

INDEPENDENT CLAUSES are joined by conjunctions; such as, _hence,
but, and, although_, etc.

DEPENDENT CLAUSES are joined to the sentence by relative adverbs;
such as, _where, when_, etc., or by relative pronouns; as, _who,
what_, etc. These dependent clauses may have the same office in
the sentence as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, or adverbs. (See §7.)

79. CASE AND NUMBER OF RELATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS. Failure
to use the proper case and number of the relative pronouns has
already been touched upon (see §29), but a further mention of this
fault may well be made here.

The relative pronoun has other offices in the sentence than that
of connecting the dependent and principal clauses. It may serve
as a subject or an object in the clause. The sentence, _I wonder
WHOM will be chosen_, is wrong, because the relative here is the
subject of _will be chosen_, not the object of _wonder_, and should
have the nominative form _who_. Corrected, it reads, _I wonder
WHO will be chosen_. Examine the following sentences:

Wrong: We know _who_ we mean.

Right: We know _whom_ we mean.

Wrong: You may give it to _whoever_ you wish.

Right: You may give it to _whomever_ you wish.

Wrong: Do you know _whom_ it is?

Right: Do you know _who_ it is? (Attribute complement.)

Wrong: Everybody _who were_ there were disappointed. (Disagreement
in number.)

Right: Everybody _who was_ there was disappointed.

The relative pronoun takes the case required by the clause it
introduces, not the case required by any word preceding it. Thus,
the sentence, _He gave it to WHO had the clearest right_, is correct,
because _who_ is the subject of the verb _had_, and therefore in
the nominative case. _Give it to WHOMEVER they name_, is right,
because _whomever_ is the object of _they name_.

Errors in the use of interrogative pronouns are made in the same
way as in the use of the relatives. The interrogative pronoun has
other functions besides making an interrogation. It serves also as
the subject or object in the sentence. Care must be taken, then,
to use the proper case. Say, _Whom are you looking for?_ not, _Who
are you looking for?_

NOTE. Some writers justify the use of _who_ in sentences like the
last one on the ground that it is an idiom. When, as in this book,
the object is training in grammar, it is deemed better to adhere
to the strictly grammatical form.

EXERCISE 58

_In the following sentences, choose the proper forms from those
italicized:_

  1. _Who whom_ do you wish to see?
  2. You will please write out the name of _whoever whomever_ you want.
  3. I saw _who whom_ was there.
  4. _Who whom_ was it you saw?
  5. _Who whom_ did you see?
  6. John did not know _whom who_ to ask.
  7. Why did he not ask _whomever whoever_ was there?
  8. _Who whom_ can tell the difference?
  9. Give it to _whoever whomever_ you please.
 10. None of those who _were was_ wanted _was were_ there.
 11. The one of those who _were was_ wanted was not there.
 12. He is one of those fellows who _are is_ always joking.
 13. _Whom who_ was called "The Rail Splitter?"
 14. Do you not know _whom who_ it was?
 15. That is one of the birds that _is are_ very rare.
 16. One of the books which _was were_ brought was one hundred years old.
 17. I am not among those _who whom were was_ there.
 18. Only one of the men who _were was_ on board survived.
 19. Everyone else who _was were_ there _was were_ lost.
 20. I am the one of the three men who _is am are_ guilty.
 21. He was chosen one of the four speakers who _was were_ to speak
     on Commencement Day.
 22. It was one of the books which _were was_ being sought by the
     librarian.
 23. Give it to one of the men _who whom_ is found there.
 24. To _who whom_ did you give it?
 25. It was for _whomever whoever_ was present.
 26. Ask _whomever whoever_ is nearest the door.

80. CONJUNCTIVE OR RELATIVE ADVERBS. It is better to use a _WHEN_
CLAUSE only in the subordinate part of the sentence, to state the
time of an event. Compare the following:

Bad: He was turning the corner, when suddenly he saw a car approaching.
Good: When he was turning the corner, he suddenly saw a car approaching.

Bad: When the news of the fire came, it was still in the early morning.
Good: The news of the fire came when it was still in the early morning.

81. Do not use a _WHEN_ or a _WHERE_ CLAUSE in defining a subject
or in place of a predicate noun.

Bad: Commencement is when one formally completes his school course.
Good: Commencement is the formal completion of one's school course.

Bad: Astronomy is where one studies about the stars.
Good: Astronomy is the study of the stars.

82. _So, then_, and _also_, the conjunctive adverbs, should not
be used to unite coördinate verbs in a sentence unless _and_ or
_but_ be used in addition to the adverb.

Bad: The boys' grades are low, _so_ they indicate lack of application.
Good: The boys' grades are low, _and so_ indicate lack of application.

Bad: He read for a while, _then_ fell asleep.
Good: He read for a while, _and then_ fell asleep.

Bad: I'll be down next week; _also_ I shall bring Jack along.
Good: I'll be down next week; _and also_ I shall bring Jack along.

EXERCISE 59

_Correct the following sentences:_

  1. Anarchism is when one believes in no government.
  2. I am studying German, also French.
  3. The clock had just struck five when the cab came.
  4. I shall work until nine o'clock, then I shall retire.
  5. I was sick all day, so I couldn't come to the office.
  6. I was going up street yesterday when unexpectedly I met Jones.
  7. Death is when one ceases to live.
  8. Dinner is ready, so I shall have to cease work.
  9. He told half of the story, then he suddenly stopped.
 10. He loves good music, also good pictures.
 11. A restaurant is where meals are served.

83. CONJUNCTIONS. There are certain conjunctions, and also certain
pairs of conjunctions that frequently cause trouble.

AND or BUT should not be used to join a dependent clause to an
independent clause; as, _It was a new valise AND differing much
from his old one_. Say instead, _It was a new valise, differing
much from his old one_, or _It was a new valise, and differed very
much from his old one_. Similarly, _It was a new book WHICH_ (not
_and which_) _interested him very much_. This "and which" construction
is a frequent error; _and which_ should never be used unless there
is more than one relative clause, and then never with the first
one.

BUT or FOR should not be used to introduce both of two succeeding
statements. Both of the following sentences are bad by reason of
this error: _He likes geometry, BUT fails in algebra, BUT studies
it hard, He read all night, FOR the book interested him, FOR it
was along the line of his ambition_.

THAN and AS should not be followed by objective pronouns in sentences
like this: _I am as large AS HIM_. The verb in these sentences
is omitted. If it is supplied, the error will be apparent. The
sentence would then read, _I am as large as HIM (is large)_. The
correct form is, _I am as large as he (is large)_. Similarly, _He
is taller than I (am tall), She is brighter than HE (is bright)_.

AS may be used as either a conjunction or an adverb. _He is AS
tall AS I_. The first _as_ is an adverb, the second _as_ is a
conjunction. _As_ is properly used as an adverb when the equality
is asserted, but, when the equality is denied, _so_ should be used
in its place. _He is AS old AS I_, is correct, but the denial should
be, _He is NOT SO old AS I_. After _not_ do not use _as_ when _as_
is an adverb.

NEITHER, when used as a conjunction, should be followed by NOR;
as, _Neither he NOR (not or) I can come. Neither_ should never
be followed by _or_.

EITHER, when used as a conjunction, should be followed by OR.

84. PLACING OF CORRELATIVES. The correlatives, such as _neither--nor,
either--or, not only--but also_, should be placed in clear relation
to similar parts of speech or similar parts of the sentence. One
should not be directed toward a verb and the other toward some
other part of speech.

Bad: He _not only_ brought a book, _but also_ a pencil.
Good: He brought _not only_ a book _but also_ a pencil.

Bad: He would offer _neither_ reparation _nor_ would he apologize.
Good: _Neither_ would he offer reparation _nor_ would he apologize.
Good: He would offer _neither_ reparation _nor_ apology.

85. The prepositions _without, except, like_, and the adverb _directly_
should not be used as conjunctions.

Wrong: _Without_ (_unless_) you attend to class-room work, you cannot
pass.

Wrong: This she would not do _except_ (_unless_) we promised to
pay at once.

Wrong: I acted just _like_ (_as_) all the others (did).

Wrong: _Directly_ (_as soon as_) he came, we harnessed the horses.

 24. He took an interest neither in studies, nor did he care for
     athletics.
 25. He neither took an interest in studies nor athletics.

EXERCISE 61

_Construct sentences in which the following words are correctly
used:_

When, where, than, as--as, so--as, neither--nor, not only--but also,
either--or, except, like, without, directly.

86. PREPOSITIONS. Some mistakes are made in the use of prepositions.
Note the following brief list of words with the appropriate prepositions
to be used with each:

agree _with_ a person                 differ _from_ (person or thing)
agree _to_ a proposition              differ _from_ or _with_ an opinion
bestow _upon_                         different _from_
compare _with_ (to determine value)   glad _of_
compare _to_ (because of similarity)  need _of_
comply _with_                         part _from_ (a person)
confide _in_ (to trust in)            part _with_ (a thing)
confide _to_ (to intrust to)          profit _by_
confer _on_ (to give)                 prohibit _from_
confer _with_ (to talk with)          reconcile _to_ (a person)
convenient _to_ (a place)             reconcile _with_ (a statement)
convenient _for_ (a purpose)          scared _by_
dependent _on_                        think _of_ or _about_

Do not use prepositions where they are unnecessary. Note the following
improper expressions in which the preposition should be omitted:

continue _on_                           _down_ until
covered _over_                          inside _of_
off _of_                                outside _of_
started _out_                           where _to_?
wish _for_ to come                      remember _of_
more than you think _for_

Do not omit any preposition that is necessary to the completeness
of the sentence.

Bad: He is a dealer and shipper _of_ coal.

Good: He is a dealer _in_ and shipper _of_ coal.

CHAPTER VII

SENTENCES

87. Classified as to their rhetorical construction, sentences are
considered as loose, periodic, and balanced.

The LOOSE SENTENCE is so constructed that it may be closed at two
or more places and yet make complete sense; as,

Napoleon felt his _weakness_, and tried to win back popular _favor_
by concession after _concession_, until, at his fall, he had nearly
restored parliamentary _government_.

Note that this sentence could be closed after the words. _weakness,
favor_, and _concession_, as well as after _government_.

88. The PERIODIC SENTENCE holds the complete thought in suspense
until the close of the sentence. Compare the following periodic
sentence with the loose sentence under §87:

Napoleon, feeling his weakness, and trying to win back popular favor
by concession after concession, had, at his fall, nearly restored
parliamentary government.

Both loose and periodic sentences are proper to use, but, since
periodic sentences demand more careful and definite thought, the
untrained writer should try to use them as much as possible.

89. The BALANCED SENTENCE is made up of parts similar in form,
but often contrasted in meaning; as, _He is a man; Jones is a
gentleman._

90. SENTENCE LENGTH. As to the length of the sentence there is
no fixed rule. Frequently, sentences are too long, and are, in
their thought, involved and hard to follow. On the other hand, if
there is a succession of short sentences, choppiness and roughness
are the result. One should carefully examine sentences which contain
more than thirty or thirty-five words to see that they are clear
in their meaning and accurate in their construction.

EXERCISE 64

_Compose, or search out in your reading, five loose sentences, five
periodic sentences, and five balanced sentences._

EXERCISE 65

_In the following sentences, determine whether each sentence is
loose, periodic, or balanced. Change all loose sentences to the
periodic form:_

1. At the same time the discontent of the artisans made the lower
class fear a revolution, and that class turned to Napoleon, because
they felt him to be the sole hope for order and stable government.

2. The members of the council were appointed by the king, and held
office only at his pleasure.

3. A society and institutions that had been growing up for years
was overturned and swept away by the French Revolution.

4. Galileo was summoned to Rome, imprisoned, and forced publicly
to adjure his teaching that the earth moved around the sun.

5. He draws and sketches with tolerable skill, but paints abominably.

6. Loose sentences may be clear; periodic sentences may not be clear.

7. He rode up the mountains as far as he could before dismounting
and continuing the ascent on foot.

8. They visited the town where their father had lived, and while
there, procured the key to the house in which he had been born.

9. His death caused great grief and extreme financial distress in
the family.

10. There stands the Tower of London in all its grimness and centuries
of age, holding within its walls the scene of many a stirring tragedy.

11. Few men dislike him, but many would gladly see him overthrown
merely as an example.

12. Germany is moving in the same direction, although the reformers
find it a hard task to influence public opinion, and a far harder
one to change the various laws prevalent in the many German states.

13. Is this thing we call life, with all its troubles, pains, and
woes, after all, worth living?

14. He read much, but advanced little intellectually, for all the
facts and philosophy of his reading found no permanent lodgment
in his mind.

15. His coming home was very unexpected, because he had started
on a trip that usually took ten days, and that he had said would
take longer this time.

16. It was during the time of the National Convention that Napoleon
first became very prominent by defending the convention against
a mob.

EXERCISE 66

_Combine each of the following groups of sentences into one well
constructed long sentence:_

1. In highly developed commercial communities banks cannot afford
space in their vaults for valuables. Especially, they cannot afford
it merely to accommodate their patrons. Hence, in such communities
the furnishing of places for safe deposit has become a separate
business.

2. History should be a part of the course in all schools. It develops
the memory. It furnishes the explanation of many social phenomena.
It broadens the intellectual view. It gives culture as no other
study can give it.

3. He never desired a higher education. This was possible because
of the money bequeathed to him by his father. It had left him no
need for a great earning capacity. More likely, it was because
of the inborn dulness and lethargy of his mind.

4. New York is the pivotal state in all national elections. Its
great number of electors makes it always possible for it to throw
the election either way. Therefore, until one knows to which party
New York will fall, he cannot tell how the election will result.

5. Our forefathers were devout. They were easily shocked in many
ways. However, they permitted many liberties in the application
of sermons to particular individuals. Such things would nowadays

the future.

clothing. They were compelled to assume a peculiar manner, and
to talk in a peculiar style. Yet they gloried in their liberty.

of statistics. This forest is formidable and complicated. It causes
one, in time, to doubt the truth of numbers.

was by reason of the scaffolding which surrounded it. The castle
was now being transformed into a national museum.

slightly. Otherwise, he looked well and happy. He was moving about
shaking hands right and left.

11. They rushed at him with a yell. He had by this time reached
the base of the fountain. With a sudden wonderful leap he sprang
onto the railing. There he was out of reach. He balanced himself
by touching the brackets which held the lamps.

12. The unintelligent worker reminds one of the squirrel on the
wheel. The squirrel rushes round and round and round all day long.
At the end of the day the squirrel is still a squirrel. It is still
rushing round and round. It is getting nowhere.

13. The man looked at the ladder. He believed he could reach it.
There was a sudden flash of hope in his face. His face was already
scorched by the fire.

to his home. He crawled on top of the trucks of an express car.
The car was about to leave the terminal. He courted almost certain
death.

15. The commander again looks toward the hills. He looks for a
long time. Something seems to excite his apprehension. He converses
earnestly with the staff officer. Then the two look more than once
toward a poplar tree. The tree stands at the top of the hill. Only
its top half shows. The hill is on the east.

16. The most important political question has been the tariff question.
This has been most important for ten years. It is important because
it is believed to have caused high prices and trusts.

17. The pleasantest month is June. It has flowers. It has mild
weather. It has a slight haze in the atmosphere. These things seem
to flood one's soul with peace and contentment.

91. The essential qualities that a sentence should possess, aside
from correctness, are those of Unity, Coherence, Emphasis, and
Euphony.

UNITY. Unity demands that the sentence deal with but one general
thought, and that it deal with it in such a consistent and connected
manner that the thought is clearly and effectively presented. Unity
demands, also, that closely related thoughts should not be improperly
scattered among several sentences.

1. Statements having no necessary relation to one another should
not be embodied in one sentence.

Bad: The house sat well back from the road, _and its owner_ was
a married man.
Good: The house sat well back from the road. _Its owner_ was a
married  man.

a. Avoid the "comma blunder"; that is, do not use a comma to divide
into clauses what should be separate sentences, or should be connected
by a conjunction.

Bad: Jones lives in the country, _he_ has a fine library.
Good: Jones lives in the country. _He_ has a fine library.
Good: Jones lives in the country _and has_ a fine library.

b. Avoid the frequent use of the parenthesis in the sentence.

Bad: This is a city (it is called a city, though it has but twelve
hundred people) that has no school-house.

2. Avoid all slipshod construction of sentences.

a. Avoid adding a clause to an apparently complete thought.

Bad: That is not an easy problem, _I think_.
Good: That, _I think_, is not an easy problem.
Good: _I do not think_ that is an easy problem.

Bad: He could not be elected mayor again under any circumstances,
_at least so I am told_.
Good: He could not, _I am told_, be elected mayor again under any
circumstances.
Good: _I am told_ that he could not under any circumstances be elected
mayor again.

b. Avoid long straggling sentences.

Poor: The students often gathered to watch the practice of the
team, but, just before the last game, the management excluded almost
all, and only a few who had influence were allowed to enter, and
this favoritism caused much hard feeling and disgust, so that the
students were reluctant to support the team, and lost most of their
interest, a fact which had a bad effect on the athletics of the
institution.

3. Unite into one sentence short sentences and clauses that are
closely and logically connected with one another.

Bad: That it is a good school is not without proof. Its diploma
admits to all colleges.
Good: That it is a good school is not without proof, for its diploma
admits to all colleges.
Good: That its diploma admits to all colleges is proof that it is
a good school.

Bad: This fact was true of all of us. With the exception of John.
Good: This fact was true of all of us, with the exception of John.

Bad: Edward came. But John never appeared.
Good: Edward came, but John never appeared.

Bad: The town has two railroads running through it. Also, three
trolley lines.
Good: The town has two railroads running through it, and also three
trolley lines.
Good: The town has two railroads and three trolley lines running
through it.

4. Do not change the point of view.

Bad: _We_ completed our themes, and _they_ were handed in to the
teacher. (In the first part of the sentence, the subject is _we_;
in the second it is _themes_.)
Good: We completed our themes and handed them in to the teacher.
Good: Our themes were completed and handed in to the teacher.

Bad: The _stage_ took us to the foot of the hill, and _we_ walked
from there to the top, where _our friends_ met us.
Good: _We_ were taken to the foot of the hill by the stage, and _we_
walked from there to the top, where _we_ were met by our friends.

and that we could go to Seattle and back for fifty dollars, and
so, when our checks came, we seized our grips and started on a

months we had ever spent, and gave us an experience that was very
valuable in our work, which we took up on our return in the fall.

the trouble was.

in a similar manner.

EXERCISE 72

_Secure five examples under each of the above rules, except the
last._

RULES FOR PUNCTUATION

101. Punctuation should not be done for its own sake, but simply
to make the meaning clearer; never punctuate where no punctuation
is needed.

The following rules of punctuation are generally accepted:

_The Period_ (.)

102. Use the period after (1) every complete sentence that is not
interrogative nor exclamatory; (2) after every abbreviation; and
(3) after _Yes_ and _No_ when used alone.

_The Interrogation Point_ (?)

103. Use the interrogation point after every direct question.

_The Exclamation Point_ (!)

104. Use the exclamation point after every exclamatory sentence
or expression.

Alas! It is too late.

Fire if you dare!

_The Comma_ (,)

105. Use the comma after each word of a series of words that all
have the same grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence,
unless conjunctions are used between all of those words.

Ours is a red, white, and blue flag.

He talked, smoked, and read.

He talked and smoked and read.

Do not, however, precede the series by a comma.

Wrong: He lectures on, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

Right: He lectures on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

106. Use the comma to separate two adjectives modifying the same
noun, but not if one modifies both the other adjective and the
noun.

An honest, upright man.

An old colored man.

A soiled red dress.

107. Use the comma to set off non-emphatic introductory words or
phrases, and participial phrases.

John, come here.

By the way, did you see Mary?

After having done this, Cæsar crossed the Rubicon.

Cæsar crossed the Rubicon, thus taking a decisive step.

1), or a geographical name that limits a preceding name.

He was told to see Dr. Morton, the principal of the school.

Muncy, Pennsylvania, is not spelled the same as Muncie, Indiana.

109. Use the comma to set off any sentence element that is placed
out of its natural order.

If it is possible, he will do it.

To most people, this will seem absurd.

110. Use the comma to set off slightly parenthetical remarks that
are thrown into the sentence. If the break is very marked, use
the dash or parenthesis.

That, if you will permit me to explain, cannot be done without
permission from the police.

Two men, Chase and Arnold, were injured.

He, himself, said it.

111. Use the comma to set off explanatory or non-restrictive clauses,
but not to set off restrictive clauses. (See §§ 25 and 26.)

Mr. Gardner, who has been working in the bank, sang at the church.

But: The Mr. Gardner whom you know is his brother.

112. Use the comma to separate coördinate clauses that are united
by a simple conjunction.

He can sing well, but he seldom will sing in public.

He doesn't wish to sing, and I do not like to urge him.

113. Use the comma to separate the members of a compound sentence
when those members are short and closely connected in their thought.

John carried the suit-case, I the hat box, and William the umbrella.

114. Use the comma to separate dependent and conditional clauses
introduced by such words as _if, when, though,_ unless the connection
be close.

He did not stop, though I called repeatedly.

Your solution is right in method, even if you have made a mistake
in the work.

But: You are wrong when you say that.

115. Use the comma to set off short, informal quotations, unless
such quotation is a word or phrase closely woven into the sentence.

William said, "Good morning"; but, "Hello," was Henry's greeting.

But: He introduced the man as "my distinguished friend."

116. Use the comma to set off adverbs and adverbial phrases; such
as, _however, then, also, for example, so to speak,_ etc.

Such a man, however, can seldom be found.

This sentence, for example, can be improved by changing the order.

117. Use the comma whenever for any reason there is any distinct
pause in the sentence that is not otherwise indicated by punctuation,
or whenever something clearly is omitted.

We want students, not boys who simply come to school.

Cæsar had his Brutus; Charles the First, his Cromwell; ...

_The Semicolon_ (;)

118. Use the semicolon to separate the clauses of a compound sentence
that are long or that are not joined by conjunctions.

He says that he shall teach for two more years; then he shall probably
return to college.

119. Use a semicolon to separate the clauses of a compound sentence
that are joined by a conjunction, only when it is desirable to
indicate a very definite pause.

reason for it.

120. Use a semicolon to separate the parts of a compound or a complex
sentence, when some of those parts are punctuated by commas.

As men, we admire the man that succeeds; but, as honest men, we
cannot admire the man that succeeds by dishonesty.

Wrong: He spends his money for theatres, and dinners, and wine,
and for his family he has not a cent.

Right: He spends his money for theatres, and dinners, and wine;
and for his family he has not a cent.

121. Use a semicolon before certain adverbs and adverbial expressions,
when they occur in the body of the sentence and are used conjunctively;
such as, _accordingly, besides, hence, thus, therefore_, etc.

I do not care to see the game; besides, it is too cold.

John is sick; however, I think he will be here.

122. Use the semicolon before the expressions, _namely, as, that
is_, etc., or before their abbreviations, _viz., i.e.,_ etc., when
they are used to introduce a series of particular terms, simple
in form, which are in apposition with a general term.

At present there are four prominent political parties; namely, the
Republican, the Democratic, the Prohibition, and the Socialist.

_The Colon_ (:)

123. Use the colon after an introduction to a long or formal quotation,
before an enumeration, or after a word, phrase, or sentence that
constitutes an introduction to something that follows.

Mr. Royer says in his letter: "You will remember that I promised
to send you a copy of my latest musical composition. I am mailing
it to you to-day."

There are four essentials of a legal contract: competent parties,
consideration, agreement, and legal subject matter.

124. Use the colon after the salutation of a formal letter. (See
§161.)

_The Dash_ (--)

125. Use the dash to indicate any sudden break in thought or
construction.

I am pleased to meet you, Captain--what did you say your name is?

The man I met--I refer to Captain Jones--was in the naval service.

126. Use the dash in the place of the comma to set off more definitely
some part of a sentence.

I was always lacking what I needed most--money.

127. Use the dash preceded by a comma before a word which sums up
the preceding part of a sentence.

Democrats, Republicans, Prohibitionists, Socialists, and
Populists,--_all_ were there.

128. Do not use dashes where not required or in place of some other
mark of punctuation.

_The Parenthesis Marks_ ( )

129. Use the parenthesis marks only to enclose a statement that
is thrown into the sentence, but is grammatically independent of
it.

He belongs (at least so it is said) to every secret society in town.

130. Do not use a comma or other punctuation mark with the parenthesis
marks unless it would be required even if there were no parenthesis.
When other punctuation is used it should follow the parenthesis.

They sent us (as they had agreed to do) all the papers in the case.

We expect John to bring his roommate home with him (he has been
very anxious to do so); but we expect no one else.

Modern usage is to avoid entirely the use of the parentheses.

_The Bracket_ [ ]

131. Use the bracket to enclose some statement or word of the writer
that is thrown into a quotation by way of explanation or otherwise.

His letter reads: "We have decided to get Mr. Howard [his cousin]
to deliver the address..."

_The Quotation Marks_ (" ")

132. Use quotation marks to enclose quotations of the exact language
of another.

The Bible says, "Charity suffereth long."

133. Use single quotation marks (' ') to enclose a quotation within
a quotation.

The speaker in closing said: "I can imagine no more inspiring words
than those of Nelson at Trafalgar, 'England expects every man to
do his duty.'"

134. If a quotation consists of several paragraphs, quotation marks
should precede each paragraph and follow the last.

135. Do not use quotation marks to enclose each separate sentence
of a single continuous quotation.

136. Do not use quotation marks to enclose well-known nicknames,
titles of books, proverbial phrases, or to indicate one's own literary
invention.

137. Examine the location of quotation marks and other punctuation
in the following sentences:

Wrong: "You may do as you wish, he said, if you only wish to do
right."

Right: "You may do as you wish," he said, "if you only wish to do
right."

Wrong: "Can you come," she asked?

Right: "Can you come?" she asked.

_The Apostrophe_ (')

138. Use the apostrophe to mark certain plurals and possessives.
See §§ 13 and 15.

Use the apostrophe to indicate the omission of letters.

Doesn't, Can't, What's the matter?

_The Hyphen_ (-)

139. Use the hyphen when a word must be divided at the end of a
line.

Never divide words of one syllable, nor short words; such as, _though,
through, also, besides, over_, etc.

Never divide words except at the end of a syllable, and always
put the hyphen at the end of the first line, not at the beginning
of the second.

Wrong division: _int-end, prop-ose, superint-endent, expre-ssion_.

Proper division: _in-tend, pro-pose, superin-tendent, expres-sion_.

In writing it is good usage not to divide a word like _expression_
by placing _ex_ on one line and the rest of the word on the next
line.

140. Use the hyphen to divide certain compound words. No rule can
be given by which to determine when compounded words demand the
hyphen. Only custom determines.

Always use a hyphen with _to-day, to-morrow_, and _to-night_.

the marks of punctuation selections from books, and afterwards
inserting the proper marks.




CHAPTER IX

THE PARAGRAPH

141. The PARAGRAPH is a connected series of sentences all dealing
with the development of a single topic. Where the general subject
under discussion is very narrow, the paragraph may constitute the
whole composition; but usually, it forms one of a number of subtopics,
each dealing with some subdivision of the general subject. For each
one of these subtopics a separate paragraph should be made.

The purpose of the paragraph is to aid the reader to comprehend
the thought to be expressed. The paragraph groups in a logical way
the different ideas to be communicated. It gives rest to the eye
of the reader, and makes clearer the fact that there is a change
of topic at each new paragraph.

142. PARAGRAPH LENGTH. There is no fixed rule governing the proper
length of the paragraph, but, probably, no paragraph need be more
than three hundred words in length. If the whole composition is not
more than two hundred and fifty words in length, it will not often
need to be subdivided into paragraphs. In a letter, paragraphing
should be more frequent than in other compositions.

Paragraphing should not be too frequent. If paragraphing is too
frequent, by making each minute subdivision of equal importance,
it defeats its purpose of grouping ideas about some general topic.

143. Sometimes a sentence or even a part of a sentence may be set
off as a separate paragraph in order to secure greater emphasis.
This, however, is only using the paragraph for a proper purpose--to
aid in gaining clearness.

144. PARAGRAPHING OF SPEECH. In a narrative, each direct quotation,
together with the rest of the sentence of which it is a part, should
constitute a separate paragraph. This rule should be always followed
in writing a conversation. Examine the following:

A certain Scotch family cherishes this anecdote of a trip which
Dr. Samuel Johnson made to Scotland. He had stopped at the house
of this family for a meal, and was helped to the national dish.
During the meal the hostess asked:

"Dr. Johnson, what do you think of our Scotch broth?"

"Madam," was the answer, "in my opinion it is fit only for pigs."

"Then have some more," said the woman.

The only case in which the quoted words can be detached from the
remainder of the sentence is where they form the end of the sentence
after some introductory words, as in the second paragraph of the
example just given.

145. INDENTATION OF THE PARAGRAPH. The first sentence of each new
paragraph should be indented. See example under §144. No other
sentence should be so indented.

146. The essential qualities which each paragraph should have are:
Unity, Coherence, and Emphasis.

UNITY. Unity requires that the paragraph should deal with only one
subject, and should include nothing which does not have a direct
bearing on that subject. Thus, in the following paragraph, the
italicized sentence violates the principle of Unity, because, very
obviously it belongs to some other paragraph:

Never did any race receive the Gospel with more ardent enthusiasm
than the Irish. _St. Patrick, a zealous priest, was thought to
have banished the snakes from the island_. So enthusiastic were
the Irish, that, not content with the religious work in Ireland,
the Irish Church sent out its missionaries to Scotland, to Germany,
and to the Alps and Apennines. It founded religious houses and
monasteries....

Separate paragraphs should not be made of matter which belongs
together. If the ideas can all be fairly included under one general
topic, unity demands that they be grouped in one paragraph. Thus,
in describing the route followed in a certain journey, one should
not use a separate paragraph for each step in the journey.

Wrong:

In returning to the University, I went from Pittsburgh to Cleveland.

Then I took a berth for the night on one of the lake steamers running
from Cleveland to Detroit.

From Detroit I completed the journey to Ann Arbor on an early train
the next morning.

If unity is to be secured, not only must all the ideas brought
out in the paragraph deal with the same topic, but also, they must
be developed in some consistent, systematic order. A certain point
of view should be generally maintained as to tense, subject, and
manner of expression.

147. HOW TO GAIN UNITY. Careful thought before beginning the paragraph
is necessary if unity is to be gained. The topic of the paragraph
should be determined, and should be clearly indicated by a topic
sentence. Usually this topic sentence should be placed near the
beginning of the paragraph. The first sentence is the clearest
and best place for it. The topic sentence need not be a formal
statement of the subject to be discussed, but may be any sentence
that shows what is to be the central idea of the paragraph.

With the topic determined, there are various ways of developing it.
It may be developed by repetition; by adding details and specific
instances to the general statement; by presenting proof; by
illustration; or by showing cause or effect.

148. Examine the following paragraphs. Each possesses the quality
of unity. The topic sentence in each case is italicized.

_To rule was not enough for Bonaparte._ He wanted to amaze, to
dazzle, to overpower men's souls, by striking, bold, magnificent,
and unanticipated results. To govern ever so absolutely would not
have satisfied him, if he must have governed silently. He wanted
to reign through wonder and awe, by the grandeur and terror of his
name, by displays of power which would rivet on him every eye, and
make him the theme of every tongue. Power was his supreme object;
but power which should be gazed at as well as felt, which should
strike men as a prodigy, which should shake old thrones as an
earthquake, and, by the suddenness of its new creations, should
awaken something of the submissive wonder which miraculous agency
inspires.

From _The Character of Napoleon Bonaparte_, by Channing.

_There is something in the very season of the year that gives a
charm to the festivity of Christmas._ At other times we derive a
great portion of our pleasures from the mere beauties of Nature.
Our feelings sally forth and dissipate themselves over the sunny
landscape and we "live abroad and everywhere." The song of the bird,
the murmur of the stream, the breathing fragrance of spring, the
soft voluptuousness of summer, the golden pomp of autumn; earth with
its mantle of refreshing green, and heaven with its deep delicious
blue and its cloudy magnificence--all fill us with mute but exquisite
delight, and we revel in the luxury of mere sensation. But in the
depth of winter, when Nature lies despoiled of every charm, and
wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn our gratifications
to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of the landscape,
the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they circumscribe
our wanderings, shut in also our feelings from rambling abroad,
and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasures of the social
circle. Our thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly sympathies
more aroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society,
and are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for
enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart, and we draw our pleasures from
the deep wells of living kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of
our bosoms; and which, where resorted to, furnish forth the pure
element of domestic felicity.

From _Christmas_, by Washington Irving.

149. COHERENCE. Coherence demands that each paragraph shall be
perfectly clear in its meaning, and that it be so constructed that
it may be readily grasped by the reader. The relation of sentence
to sentence, of idea to idea, must be clearly brought out. The
whole fabric of the paragraph must be woven together--it must not
consist of disconnected pieces.

150. HOW TO GAIN COHERENCE. Where vividness or some other quality
does not gain coherence in the sentence, it is usually gained by
the use of words or phrases which refer to or help to keep in mind
the effect of the preceding sentences, or which show the bearing of
the sentence on the paragraph topic. These words may be of various
sorts; as, _it, this view, however, in this way_, etc. Sometimes
the subject is repeated occasionally throughout the paragraph,
or is directly or indirectly indicated again at the end of the
paragraph.

Examine carefully the following selections. Note the italicized
words of coherence, and note in each case how they aid the flow
of thought from sentence to sentence, and help to keep in mind
the paragraph topic.

I will give you my opinion and advice in regard to the _two books_
you have named. The _first_ is interesting and easy to read. _It_
is, _also_, by no means lacking in the value of the information
it presents. _But the second_, while it is no less interesting
and equally valuable in its contents, seems to me far more logical
and scholarly in its construction. _In addition to this_ I think
you will find it cheaper in price, by reason of its not being so
profusely illustrated. _Therefore_, I should advise you to procure
the _second_ for your study. _Either, indeed_, will do, but since
you have a choice, take the better one.

A Husbandman who had a quarrelsome family, after having tried in
vain to reconcile them by words, thought he might more readily
prevail by an example. _So_ he called his sons and bade them lay
a bundle of sticks before him. _Then having tied them_ up into a
fagot, he told _the lads_, one after another, to take it up and
break it. _They all tried_, but tried in vain. _Then_, untying
_the fagot_, he gave _them_ the sticks to break one by one. _This_
they did with the greatest ease. _Then_ said the father: "_Thus_,
my sons, as long as you remain united, you are a match for all your
enemies; but differ and separate, and you are undone." _Æsop's
Fables_.

Examine also the selections under §§ 205 and 206.

151. EMPHASIS. The third quality which a paragraph should possess
is emphasis. The paragraph should be so constituted as to bring
into prominence the topic or the point it is intended to present.
The places of greatest emphasis are usually at the beginning and at
the end of the paragraph. In short paragraphs sufficient emphasis
is generally gained by having a topic sentence at the beginning.
In longer paragraphs it is often well to indicate again the topic
at the end by way of summary in order to impress thoroughly on
the reader the effect of the paragraph.

EXERCISE 74

_The few following suggestions for practice in paragraph construction
are given by way of outline. Additional subjects and exercises
will readily suggest themselves to teacher or student._

_These topics are intended to apply only to isolated
paragraphs--"paragraph themes." As has been suggested, more latitude
in the matter of unity is allowed in compositions so brief that
more than one paragraph is unnecessary._

Write paragraphs:

 1. Stating the refusal of a position that has been offered to you,
    and giving your reasons for the refusal.

 2. Describing the appearance of some building. Give the general
    appearance and then the details.

 3. Explaining how to tie a four-in-hand necktie.

 4. Stating your reasons for liking or not liking some book or play.

 5. Describing the personal appearance of some one of your acquaintance.

 6. To prove that the world is round.

 7. To prove that it pays to buy good shoes. (Develop by illustration.)

 8. Showing by comparison that there are more advantages in city
    life than in country life.

Write paragraphs on the following subjects:

 9. My Earliest Recollection.

10. The Sort of Books I Like Best.

11. Why I Like to Study X Branch.

CHAPTER X

LETTER-WRITING

NOTE TO TEACHER.--For the purpose of training in composition, in
the more elementary work, letter-writing affords probably the most
feasible and successful means. Letter-writing does not demand any
gathering of material, gains much interest, and affords much latitude
for individual tastes in topics and expression. Besides, letter-writing
is the field in which almost all written composition will be done
after leaving school; and so all training in school will be thoroughly
useful. For this reason, it is suggested that letter-writing be
made one of the chief fields for composition work.

In Exercise 75, are given a number of suggestions for letter-writing.
Others will readily occur to the teacher.

THE HEADING

152. POSITION OF HEADING. In all business letters the writer's
address and the date of writing should precede the letter and be
placed at the upper right hand side of the sheet not less than an
inch from the top. This address and date is called the HEADING.
In friendly letters the parts of the heading are sometimes placed
at the end of the letter on the left side a short distance below
the body of the letter. This is permissible, but to place it at
the beginning in all letters is more logical and customary. Never
write part of the heading at the beginning and part at the end
of the letter.

153. ORDER OF HEADING. The parts of the heading should be sufficient
to enable the accurate addressing of a reply, and should be in
the following order: (1) the street address, (2) the town or the
city address, (3) the date. If all cannot be easily placed on one
line, two or even three lines should be used; but, in no case,
should the above order be varied. Examples:

Wrong: March 31, 1910, Red Oaks, Iowa, 210 Semple Street.

Right: 210 Semple Street, Red Oaks, Iowa, March 31, 1910.

Right: 210 Semple Street, Red Oaks, Iowa,
                        March 31, 1910.

Right: 210 Semple Street,
       Red Oaks, Iowa,
           March 31, 1910.

If only two lines are used, put the writer's address on the first
line and the date on the second.

Wrong: January 19, 1910, Sharon, Pennsylvania,
                    The Hotel Lafayette.

Right: The Hotel Lafayette, Sharon, Pennsylvania,
                   January 19, 1910.

154. PUNCTUATION OF HEADING. Place a period after each abbreviation
that is used. In addition to this, place commas after the street
address, after the town address, after the state address, and after
the number of the day of the month. Place a period after the number
of the year. Examine the correct address under §153.

155. FAULTS TO BE AVOIDED IN HEADINGS. Avoid the use of abbreviations
in the friendly letter, and avoid their too frequent use in the
business letter.

It is better to avoid abbreviating any but the longer names of states.

Avoid all such abbreviations as the following: _St._ for _Street;
Ave._ for _Avenue; Apart._ for _Apartments; Chi._ for _Chicago;
Phila._ for _Philadelphia_.

Wrong: Hardie Apart., Pbg., Pa.

Right: Hardie Apartments, Pittsburg, Pa.

Do not use the sign # before the street number.

Do not omit the word _Street_.

Wrong: 229 Market.

Right: 229 Market Street.

Do not write the date thus: _9/10/10_. Represent the numbers by
figures, not words. See §§ 75 and 76. Do not use _st., rd.,_ etc.,
after the number of the day.

Wrong: 9/8/09.

Right: September 8, 1909.

Wrong: September the Ninth, Nineteen Hundred and Nine.

Right: September 9, 1909.

Wrong: March 10th, 1910.

Right: March 10, 1910.

THE INSIDE ADDRESS

156. POSITION OF INSIDE ADDRESS. In strictly commercial letters
the name and the address of the person to whom the letter is being
sent should come at the beginning of the letter, and should begin
flush with the margin at the left side of the page, and a little
below the level of the heading. The second line of the inside address
should be set in a little from the margin. See model letters under
§174.

In formal friendly letters and in letters of a non-commercial nature,
the inside address should stand a little below the bottom of the
letter at the left side of the page. In informal friendly letters
the inside address may be omitted.

157. PUNCTUATION OF INSIDE ADDRESS. In punctuating the inside address,
place a period after each abbreviation that is used. In addition
to this, place a comma after the name of the addressee, a comma
after the street address, if one be given, and after the name of
the town or city. Place a period after the name of the state or
country. Examine the correct inside address under §174.

158. FAULTS TO BE AVOIDED IN THE INSIDE ADDRESS. Do not omit the
town, city, or state address from the inside address.

Right: Mr. R. R. Stolz,

before the name of each of the men, unless their names constitute
a partnership or trading name.

            New York City.
       Gentlemen:

Avoid all abbreviations of titles preceding the name except _Mr.,
Mrs., Messrs._, and _Dr._ Abbreviations of titles placed after
the name, such as, _Esq., D.D., A.M._, etc., are proper.

Do not use _Mr._ and _Esq._ with the same name.

Avoid all other abbreviations except in case of a state with a
very long name. In this case it is permissible to abbreviate, but
it is better form to write the name in full. _United States of
America_ may be abbreviated to _U. S. A._

Wrong: Merch. Mfg. Co.,
          N. Y. C.

       Dear Sir:

Do not place a period after the title _Miss. Miss_ is not an
abbreviation.

THE SALUTATION

159. POSITION OF SALUTATION. The salutation should begin flush
with the margin and on the line next below the inside address. See
correctly written letters under §174.

160. FORM OF SALUTATION. The salutation varies with the form of
the letter and the relations between the writer and receiver of
the letter. Where the parties are strangers or mere business
acquaintances the most common salutations for individuals are,
_Dear Sir, Dear Madam_, or _My dear Sir, My dear Madam_. For a
group of persons, or for a company or a partnership, _Gentlemen,
Dear Sirs, Dear Madams_ or _Mesdames_ are used. In less formal
business letters such salutations as, _My dear Mr. Smith_, or _Dear
Miss Jaekel_ may be used.

In the case of informal and friendly letters, as in business and
formal letters, the salutation to be used is largely a matter of
taste. The following are illustrations of proper salutations for
friendly letters: _My dear Doctor, Dear Cousin, Dear Cousin Albert,
Dear Miss Jaekel, Dear Major, My dear Miss Smith, Dear William,
Dear Friend,_ etc.

It is considered more formal to prefix _My_ to the salutation.

It is over formal to use simply _Sir_ or _Madam_ in any letter,
or to use _Dear Sir_ or _Dear Madam_ when writing to a familiar
friend.

If one uses a very familiar salutation, such as _Dear Brown, Dear
John,_ etc., it is better to put the inside address at the close
of the letter, or to omit it.

161. PUNCTUATION OF SALUTATION. Punctuate the salutation with a
colon, except in informal letters, when a comma may be used.

162. FAULTS TO BE AVOIDED IN THE SALUTATION. Use no abbreviations
except _Dr., Mr., Mrs._ Do not use the abbreviation _Dr._, when
that title is used as a final word in a salutation.

Wrong: My dear Maj. Wren:

Right: My dear Major Wren:

Wrong: My dear Dr.:

Right: My dear Doctor:

Do not use a name alone as a salutation.

Wrong: Mr. W. W. Braker:
           Will you please inform ...

Right: Mr. W. W. Braker,
           Muncy, Pennsylvania.
       Dear Sir:
           Will you please inform ...

In the salutation capitalize only the important nouns and the first
word of the salutation.

Wrong: My Dear Sir:

Right: My dear Sir:

Wrong: My very Dear Friend:

Right: My very dear Friend:

Wrong: Dear sir:

Right: Dear Sir:

THE BODY OF THE LETTER

163. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LETTER. In friendly letters much
latitude is allowed in the body of the letter, but business letters
should be brief and to the point. No letter, however, should be
lacking in the courteous forms or in completeness.

164. FORM OF BODY. The body of the letter usually begins on the
line below the salutation and is indented the same distance from
the margin as any other paragraph would be indented. See model
letters under §174.

In commercial letters paragraph divisions are made more frequently
than in other composition. Each separate point should be made the
subject of a separate paragraph.

165. FAULTS IN BODY OF THE LETTER. In letters that are intended to
be complete and formal, avoid the omission of articles, pronouns,
and prepositions. Avoid also expressions that are grammatically
incomplete. Only in extremely familiar and hasty letters should
the "telegraph style" be adopted.

Bad: Received yours of the 10th. Have had no chance to look up man.
Will do so soon.

Good: I have received your letter of the tenth. I have had no chance
as yet to look up the man, but I will do so soon.

Bad: Address c/o John Smith, Mgr. Penna. Tele.

Good: Address in care of John Smith, Manager of the Pennsylvania
Telegraph.

Bad: In reply will say ...

Good: In reply I wish to say ...

Bad: Yours of the 10th at hand.

Good: Your letter of the 10th is at hand.

Bad: Your favor received ...

Good: We have received your letter ...

Bad: Enclose P. O. money order for $2.

Good: We enclose post office money order for two dollars, ($2).

Bad: We have read your plan. Same is satisfactory.

Good: We have read your plan, and it is satisfactory.

Avoid the use of abbreviations in the letter.

It is well to avoid the too frequent use of the pronoun _I_ in
the letter, though care must be taken not to carry this caution
to extremes. _I_, however, should not be omitted when necessary
to the completeness of the sentence. Do not try to avoid its use
by omitting it from the sentence, but by substituting a different
form of sentence.

There is no objection to beginning a letter with _I_.

Punctuate the letter just as carefully as any other composition.

Excepting in letters of a formal nature, there is no objection
to the use of colloquial expressions such as _can't, don't,_ etc.

Unless you have some clear reason to the contrary, avoid the use
of expressions that have been used so much that they are worn out
and often almost meaningless. Such expressions as the following ones
are not wrong, but are often used when they are both inappropriate
and unnecessary.

Your esteemed favor is at hand.

In reply permit me to say ...

We beg leave to advise ...

We beg to suggest ...

Thanking you for the favor, we are ...

Please find enclosed ...

In answer to your favor of the tenth ...

We take pleasure in informing you ...

In reply would say ...

We beg to acknowledge receipt of your favor ...

Awaiting your further orders, we are ...

THE CLOSE

166. FINAL WORDS. Business letters frequently close with some final
words, such as, _Thanking you again for your kind assistance, I am
..., A waiting your further orders, we are_ ..., etc. These expressions
are not wrong, but are often used when not at all necessary.

167. THE COMPLIMENTARY CLOSE. The complimentary close should be
written on a separate line near the middle of the page, and should
begin with a capital letter. Appropriateness is the only guide
to the choice of a complimentary close.

The following complimentary closes are proper for business letters:

  Yours respectfully,    Yours very truly,
  Yours truly,           Very truly yours,

The following complimentary closes are proper for friendly letters:

  Yours sincerely,       Very truly yours,
  Yours very truly,      Your loving son,
  Yours cordially,       Affectionately yours,

168. FAULTS IN THE CLOSE. Do not use abbreviations, such as, _Yrs.
respy., yrs. try.,_ etc.

169. THE SIGNATURE OF THE WRITER. The letter should be so signed as
to cause no doubt or embarrassment to any one addressing a reply.
The signature should show whether the writer is a man or a woman;
and, if a woman, it should indicate whether she is to be addressed
as _Miss_ or _Mrs._ In formal letters it is customary for a woman
to indicate how she is to be addressed by signing her name in the
following manner:

  Sincerely yours,
      Caroline Jones.
    (Mrs. William Jones).

  Very truly yours,
    (Miss) Matilda Stephens.

In signing a company name write first the name of the company, and
after it the name of the writer. Example:

D. Appleton & Company,
         per J. W. Miller.

MISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIONS

170. In beginning the letter, place the address and date an inch
and a half or two inches below the top of the page.

Leave a margin of about a half inch or more on the left side of
the page. Indent the beginning of each paragraph about an inch
or more beyond the margin.

In using a four-page sheet, write on the pages in their order, 1,
2, 3, 4.

In the correctly written forms of letters under §174 observe the
indentation of the lines. The first line of the inside address
should be flush with the margin, the second somewhat set in. The
salutation should begin flush with the margin. The body of the letter
should begin on the line below the salutation, and some distance
in from the margin.

THE OUTSIDE ADDRESS

171. POSITION OF OUTSIDE ADDRESS. Place the address on the envelope
so that it balances well. Do not have it too far toward the top,
too close to the bottom, nor too far to one side. See addressed
envelope under §173. Place the stamp squarely in the upper right-hand
corner, not obliquely to the sides of the envelope.

172. PUNCTUATION OF OUTSIDE ADDRESS. Punctuation may be omitted
at the end of the lines of the address. If it is used, place a
period at the end of the last line, and a comma after each preceding
line.

Within the lines punctuate just as you would in the inside address.

If an abbreviation ends the line, always place a period after it,
whether the other lines are punctuated or not.

173. FAULTS IN THE OUTSIDE ADDRESS. Avoid the use of abbreviations
except those that would be proper in the inside address or in the
heading. See §§ 155 and 158.

Do not use the sign # before the number of the street address. No
letters or sign at all should be used there. See §155.

Mr. A. M. Weaver,
    Cambridge, Massachusetts.

My dear Sir:

I have received your letter of inquiry about the sale of my law
books. I will say in answer that at present I have no intention
of selling them.

You may, however, be able to secure what you want from H. B. Wassel,
Esquire, Commonwealth Building, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. He has
advertised the sale of a rather extensive list of books.

                                 Very truly yours,
                                            Charles M. Howell.

                                 Muncy, New York, January 12, 1909.
My dear Professor Morton:

We are trying to establish in the school here some permanent system
of keeping students' records. I have been told that you have worked
out a card method that operates successfully. If you can give me
any information in regard to your method, I shall consider it a
very great favor. I enclose a stamped envelope for your reply.

                                 Very sincerely yours,
                                                 Harris A. Plotts.

Professor E. A. Morton,
    Braddock, Pennsylvania.

                          Braddock, Pennsylvania, January 12, 1909.
My dear Mrs. Hagon:

I wish to thank you for your kind aid in securing Captain Howard
to deliver one of the lectures in our course. Only your influence
enabled us to get so good a man at so Iowa price.

                                 Very sincerely,
                                      Sylvester D. Dunlop.

                              173 State Street, Detroit, Michigan,
                                       January 23, 1910.
To whom it may concern:

It gives me great pleasure to testify to the character, ability
and attainments of Mr. E. J. Heidenreich. He has been a trusted
personal associate of mine for more than twenty years. He may be
counted upon to do successfully anything that he is willing to
undertake.

                                                 Harry B. Hutchins.

My dear Walter:

I am to be in the city only a few more weeks before leaving permanently.
Before I go, I should like to have you come out and take dinner with
me some evening. How would next Wednesday at six o'clock suit you?
If you can come at that time, will you please write or telephone
to me sometime before Tuesday?

                               Very cordially yours,
                                               Paul B. Vandine.

My dear Paul:

I shall be very glad to accept your invitation to take dinner with
you before you take final leave of the city. The time you mention,
next Wednesday evening, is entirely satisfactory to me.

I was more than pleased to receive your invitation, for the prospect
of talking over old times with you is delightful.

                                   Sincerely yours,

Gentlemen:

With this letter I enclose a check for ten dollars, for which please
send me one of your small cook stoves, of the sort listed in your
catalogue on page two hundred thirty-eight.

It will be a great favor if you will hasten the shipment of this
stove as much as possible, since it is urgently needed in a summer
cottage that I have for rent.

                           Very truly yours,

that may be needed for the new Young Women's Christian Association
Building, on Arlington Avenue, this city. I understand that institutions

The Merchant's Electric Wiring Company,
    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Gentlemen:

I am writing to ask if you can give me employment in your work
for about ten weeks beginning June 15th. I am at present taking
a course in electrical engineering at Bucknell University, and
am in my sophomore year., It is my plan to gain some practical
experience in various sorts of electrical work during the vacations
occurring in my course. This summer I want to secure practical
experience in electric wiring.

If you wish references as to my character and ability, I would
refer you to Mr. William R. Stevenson, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and
to Mr. Harry E. McCormick, Superintendent of the Street Railways
Company, Danville, Illinois.

Salary is a very slight object to me in this work, and I shall be
willing to accept whatever compensation you may see fit to offer
me.

                                Respectfully yours,
                                             Harvey H. Wilkins.

My dear Norman:

I have just heard of your good fortune and hasten to assure you
of my sincere pleasure in the news. May you find happiness and
prosperity in your new location. But do not forget that your old
friends are still living and will always be interested in your
welfare.

                             Your affectionate cousin,

The Jefferson Life Insurance Company,
    Norfolk, Virginia.

Gentlemen:

I am the holder of Policy Number 2919 in your company. In that
Policy, which was taken out about ten years ago, my occupation
is stated to be carpenter. Lately I have changed occupations, and
am now engaged in conducting a store. If, in order to maintain the
validity of my policy, the change of occupation should be recorded
on your books, will you please have the proper entry made.

I should like to know if at the present time my policy has any cash
surrender value, and if so, what that value is.

                                  Very truly yours,
                                               Arthur J. Pearse.

Mr. James R. Elliot,
    Germantown, Colorado.

My dear Elliot:

Will you please send me, as soon as you conveniently can, the addresses
of George English, Ira S. Shepherd, and G. N. Wilkinson.

This request for addresses may lead you to think that wedding
invitations are to be looked for. Your conclusion, I am happy to
say, is a correct one; I expect to be married sometime in June.

                          Cordially your friend,
                                      Charles R. Harris.

                                          March 19, 1907.
Dear Aunt Emily:

You will no doubt be surprised when you read the heading of this
letter and learn that we are now in Vienna. We had really intended,
as I wrote to you, to spend the entire months of March and April
in Berlin, but a sudden whim sent us on to this city.

Until we came to Vienna I had but a very vague idea of the city,
and thought it a place of little interest. I was surprised to find
it a place of so many beautiful buildings and beautiful streets.
Still more was I surprised to find what a festive, stylish place
it is. Paris may have the reputation for fashion and frivolity,
but Vienna lacks only the reputation; it certainly does not lack
the fashionable and frivolous air.

The other day in one of the shops here, I discovered, as I thought,
a very fine miniature. I purchased it to present to you, and have
already sent it by post. It ought to reach you as soon as this
letter.

We have not received the usual letter from you this week, but suppose
it is because we so suddenly changed our address. The necessity
of forwarding it from Berlin has probably caused the delay.

Father and Mother join in sending their love to you.

                          Your affectionate niece,
                                                 Mary.

NOTES IN THE THIRD PERSON

175. It is customary and desirable to write certain kinds of notes
in the third person. Such a note contains nothing but the body
of the note, followed at the left side of the paper, by the time
and the place of writing.

Use no pronoun but that of the third person. Never use any heading,
salutation, or signature. Use no abbreviations except _Mr., Mrs._,
or _Dr._ Spell out all dates.

176. CORRECTLY WRITTEN NOTES IN THE THIRD PERSON.

CHAPTER XI

THE WHOLE COMPOSITION

177. By the term WHOLE COMPOSITION or THEME is meant a composition
consisting of a number of related paragraphs all dealing with one
general subject, whether the composition be a narration, a description,
or an exposition.

The following general principles applying to the construction of the
whole composition are stated for the guidance of the inexperienced
writer.

178. STATEMENT OF SUBJECT. Care should be used in the statement of
the subject. It should not be so stated as to be more comprehensive
than the composition, but should be limited to cover only what is
discussed. For a small essay, instead of a big subject, take some
limited phase of that subject:

Too broad: _College, Photography, Picnics_.

Properly limited: _A College Education as an Aid to Earning Power,
Does College Life Make Loafers? Photography as a Recreation, How
Picnics Help the Doctor._

179. THE OUTLINE. Just as in the building of a house or of a machine,
if anything creditable is to be attained, a carefully made plan is
necessary before entering on the construction; so in the writing
of an essay or theme, there should be made some plan or outline,
which will determine what different things are to be discussed,
and what is to be the method of developing the discussion. By the
inexperienced writer, at least, a composition should never be begun
until an outline has been formed for its development. As soon as
the material for the composition is in hand, the outline should be
made. It should be an aid in the construction of the composition,
not a thing to be derived after the composition is completed. Only
by the previous making of an outline can a logical arrangement be
gained, topics properly subordinated, and a suitable proportion
secured in their discussion.

In the previous chapter on the paragraph the following different
subtopics, were discussed:

Definition of Paragraph.            How to Secure Unity.
Length of Paragraph.                How to Secure Coherence.
The Topic Sentence.                 Too Frequent Paragraphing.
Unity in the Paragraph.             Paragraphing of Speech.
Coherence in the Paragraph.         Paragraphing for Emphasis.
Examples of Unity.                  Examples showing how Unity is
Purpose of the Paragraph.               Destroyed.
Emphasis in the Paragraph.          The Paragraph Theme.

If the topics had been taken up in the above irregular order, a
sorry result would have been obtained. Compare the above list of
topics with the following arrangement of the same topics in a logical
outline.

THE PARAGRAPH

1. Its definition and purpose.
2. Its length.
     Paragraphing of speech.
     Paragraphing for emphasis.
     Too frequent paragraphing.
3. Its essential qualities.
     A. Unity.
          Definition.
          Examples showing how unity is destroyed.
          How to secure unity.
          The topic sentence.
          Development of topic sentence.
          Examples showing unity.
     B. Coherence.
          Definition.
          How to secure coherence.
          Examples showing coherence.
     C. Emphasis.
          Places of emphasis in the paragraph.
4. Practical construction of the paragraph.
5. The paragraph theme.

180. USE AND QUALITIES OF THE OUTLINE. The use of the outline is
not restricted to an expository composition, as above, but is also
necessary in narration and description. Usually, in a narration,
the order of time in which events occurred, is the best order in
which to present them, though other arrangements may frequently
be followed with very good reason.

In a description different methods may be followed. Often a general
description is given, and then followed by a statement of various
details. Thus, in describing a building, one might first describe
in a general way its size, its general style of architecture, and
the impression it makes on the observer. Then more particular
description might be made of its details of arrangement and
peculiarities of architecture and ornamentation.

The whole object of the outline is to secure clearness of statement
and to avoid confusion and repetition. To secure this end the outline
should present a few main topics to which all others either lead
up or upon which they depend. These topics or subtopics should all
bear some apparent and logical relation to one another. The relation
may be that of chronology; that of general statement followed by
details; that of cause and effect; or any other relation, so long
as it is a logical and natural one.

The outline should not be too minute and detailed. It should be
sufficient only to cover the various divisions of the subject-matter,
and to prevent the confusion of subtopics. A too detailed outline
tends to make the composition stiff and formal.

The outline should have proportion. The essential features of the
subject should be the main topics. Minor subjects should not be
given too great prominence, but should be subordinated to the main
topics.

181. THE BEGINNING OF THE COMPOSITION. To choose a method of beginning
a composition often causes trouble. Usually a simple, direct beginning
is the best. But sometimes an introductory paragraph is necessary
in order to explain the writer's point of view, or to indicate
to what phases of the subject attention is to be given. Examine
the following methods of beginning.

THE INDUSTRY OF LAWYER

Oddly enough, hardly any notice is taken of an industry in which
the United States towers in unapproachable supremacy above all
other nations of the earth. The census does not say a word about
it, nor does there exist more than the merest word about it in
all the literature of American self-praise.

MY CHILDHOOD FEAR OF GHOSTS

Nothing stands out more keenly in the recollection of my childhood,
than the feelings of terror which I experienced when forced to go
to bed without the protecting light of a lamp. Then it was that
dread, indefinite ghosts lurked behind every door, hid in every
clothes-press, or lay in wait beneath every bed.

THE USES OF IRON

No other metal is put to so many uses and is so indispensable as
iron.

The opening sentences of a composition should be able to stand
alone; their meaning or clearness should not depend upon reference
to the title.

Bad:

THE VALUE OF LATIN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

There is a rapidly growing belief _that this study_ has too large
a place in our high-school courses of study.

Good:

THE VALUE OF LATIN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

There is a rapidly growing belief _that Latin_ has too large a place
in our high school courses of study.

182. UNITY IN THE COMPOSITION. Unity is an essential element of
the whole composition as well as of the paragraph, and its demands
here are in general the same. Nothing must be brought into the
composition which does not fall well within the limits of the subject.
In the different subdivisions, also, nothing must be discussed
which properly belongs to some other division of the topic.

As in the paragraph, a definite point of view should be adopted
and adhered to. There must not be a continual changing of relation
of parts of the composition to the subject, nor of the writer's
relation to the subject.

A consistent point of view is especially necessary in a narrative.
If the writer is telling of events within his own experience, care
must be taken not to bring in any conversation or occurrence, at
which, by his own story, he could not have been present. A continual
changing back and forth between present and past tenses must also
be avoided. One or the other should be adopted consistently.

183. COHERENCE IN THE COMPOSITION. A composition must also be coherent.
Its different parts must be closely knit together and the whole
closely knit to the subject. Just as in the paragraph, words of
reference and transition are needed, so in the composition, words,
or sentences of reference and transition are needed, in order to
bind the whole together and show the relation of its parts.

For this purpose, the beginning of a new division or any definite
change of topic should be closely marked, so as to prevent confusion.
There should be transition sentences, or sentences which show the
change of topic from paragraph to paragraph, and yet at the same
time bridge the thought from paragraph to paragraph. These transition
sentences may come at the end of a preceding paragraph, or at the
beginning of a following one, or at both of these places.

Examine the following parts of paragraphs in which the words or
phrases showing transition from part to part are italicized:

(Last sentence of first paragraph)

... The American War was pregnant with misery of every kind.

(Second paragraph)

_The mischief, however,_ recoiled on the unhappy people of this
country, who were made the instruments by which the wicked purposes
of the authors were effected. The nation was drained of its best
blood, and of its vital resources of men and money. The expense
of the war was enormous--much beyond any former experience.

(Third paragraph)

_And yet, what has the British nation received in return_ for this
expense....

... I was now enabled to see the _extent and aspect of my prison.
In its size_ I had been greatly mistaken....

(Beginning of paragraph following one on Unity in the paragraph)

_The second of the essentials of the paragraph_, coherence, demands
that....

Frequently, in the longer compositions, a separate paragraph is
devoted to accomplishing the transition from part to part. Observe
the following:

(Paragraph 7)

... The only other law bearing on this matter is the Act of Assembly
of last year authorizing the receipts from the automobile taxes
to be used in the construction of roads. This then completes the
enumeration of what has already been done toward building good
roads.

(Paragraph 8. Transitional paragraph)

_There are, however, several promising plans for the securing of
this important result, which are now being seriously discussed._

(Paragraph 9)

_The first of these plans is_ ...

The following are a few of the words and phrases often used to
indicate transition and to show relation between the paragraphs:
_So much for, It remains to mention, In the next place, Again,
An additional reason, Therefore, Hence, Moreover, As a result of
this, By way of exception._

Examine the selection under §187.

184. THE ENDING OF THE COMPOSITION. In a longer composition, the
ending should neither be too abrupt, nor, on the other hand, should
it be too long drawn out. It should be in proportion to the length
of the composition. Usually, except in the case of a story, it
should consist of a paragraph or two by way of summary or inference.
In a story, however, the ending may be abrupt or not. The kind of
ending depends entirely upon the nature and the scheme of development
of the story. Examine the following endings:

Ending of a theme on _The Uses of Iron_:

Only some of the more important uses of this wonderful metal, iron,
have been mentioned. There are hundreds of other uses to which it
is constantly put--uses which no other metal could fill. Gold may
once have been called the king of metals, but it has long since
lost its claim to that title.

Ending of a story:

John heard her answer, and began to move slowly away from the gate.

"Good-bye," he said.

And then he was gone, forever.

Suggested subjects for the making of outlines and compositions.

  1. How I Spent my Vacation.
  2. Shall Final Examinations be Abolished?
  3. The Subjects which Should be Taught in High Schools.
  4. My Qualifications for a Position.
  5. The Uses of Iron.
  6. Paul Revere's Ride.
  7. The City Park.
  8. My Town as a Place of Residence.
  9. The Value of Railroads.
 10. Why I Believe in Local Option.
 11. A Winter's Sleigh Ride.
 12. Shall Foreign Immigration be Restricted?
 13. My Youthful Business Ventures.
 14. Why I Belong to the X Political Party.
 15. Various Methods of Heating a House.

185. Below is given in full Lincoln's _Gettysburg Speech_. It is
perfect in its English and its construction. Study it with especial
reference to its coherence, unity, and emphasis. Some of the words
of coherence have been italicized.

Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers, brought forth upon this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. _Now_ we are engaged
in a great civil war, testing whether _that nation_, or any nation
so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.

We are met on a great battle-field of _that war_. We have come
to dedicate a portion of _that field_ as the final resting-place
for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do _this. But_
in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
_struggled here_ have consecrated it far above our power to add
or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what
we say here; but it can never forget what _they did here_.

It is for us, the living, _rather_, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work which _they who fought here_ have thus far so nobly
advanced. _It is rather for us_ to be here dedicated to the great
task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last
full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that _these
dead_ shall not have died in vain; that _this nation_, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people,
by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

186. _Small Economies_, from Mrs. Gaskell's _Cranford_.

I have often noticed that everyone has his own individual small
economies--careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some
one peculiar direction--any disturbance of which annoys him more
than spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.

An old gentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence of
the failure of a Joint-Stock Bank, in which some of his money was
invested, with a stoical mildness, worried his family all through a
long summer's day because one of them had torn (instead of cutting)
out the written leaves of his now useless bank-book. Of course, the
corresponding pages at the other end came out as well, and this
little unnecessary waste of paper (his private economy) chafed
him more than all the loss of his money. Envelopes fretted his
soul terribly when they first came in. The only way in which he
could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished article
was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him,
and so making them serve again. Even now, though tamed by age, I
see him casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send
a whole inside of a half-sheet of note paper, with the three lines
of acceptance to an invitation, written on only one of the sides.

I am not above owning that I have this human weakness myself. String
is my foible. My pockets get full of little hanks of it, picked up
and twisted together, ready for uses that never come. I am seriously
annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel instead of patiently and
faithfully undoing it fold by fold. How people can bring themselves
to use india-rubber bands, which are a sort of deification of string,
as lightly as they do, I cannot imagine. To me an india rubber band
is a precious treasure. I have one which is not new--one that I
picked up off the floor nearly six years ago. I have really tried
to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not commit the
extravagance.

Small pieces of butter grieve others. They cannot attend to conversation
because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some people
have of invariably taking more butter than they want. Have you not
seen the anxious look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on
the article? They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out
of their sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing
it down; and they are really made happy if the person on whose
plate it lies unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast (which
he does not want at all) and eats up his butter. They think that
this is not waste.

Now Miss Matty Jenkins was chary of candles. We had many devices
to use as few as possible. In the winter afternoons she would sit
knitting for two or three hours--she could do this in the dark, or
by firelight--and when I asked if I might not ring for candles to
finish stitching my wristbands, she told me to "keep blind man's
holiday." They were usually brought in with tea; but we only burnt
one at a time. As we lived in constant preparation for a friend
who might come in any evening (but who never did), it required
some contrivance to keep our two candles of the same length, ready
to be lighted, and to look as if we burnt two always. The candles
took it in turns; and, whatever we might be talking or doing, Miss
Matty's eyes were habitually fixed upon the candle, ready to jump
up and extinguish it and to light the other before they had become
too uneven in length to be restored to equality in the course of
the evening.

One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me.
I had been very much tired of my compulsory "blind man's holiday,"
especially as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to
stir the fire and run the risk of awakening her; and so I could
not even sit on the rug, and scorch myself with sewing by firelight,
according to my usual custom....

CHAPTER XII

WORDS.--SPELLING.--PRONUNCIATION

188. To write and to speak good English, one must have a good working
vocabulary. He must know words and be able to use them correctly;
he must employ only words that are in good use; he must be able
to choose words and phrases that accurately express his meaning;
and he must be able to spell and pronounce correctly the words
that he uses.

WORDS

189. GOOD USE. The first essential that a word should have, is
that it be in good use. A word is in good use when it is used
grammatically and in its true sense, and is also:

(1) _Reputable_; in use by good authors and writers in general.
The use of a word by one or two good writers is not sufficient
to make a word reputable; the use must be general.

(2) _National_; not foreign or local in its use.

(3) _Present_; used by the writers of one's own time.

190. OFFENSES AGAINST GOOD USE. The offenses against good use are
usually said to be of three classes: Solecisms, Barbarisms, and
Improprieties.

191. SOLECISMS are the violations of the principles of grammar.
Solecisms have been treated under the earlier chapters on grammar.

192. BARBARISMS. The second offense against good use, a barbarism,
is a word not in reputable, present or national use. The following
rules may be given on this subject:

1. AVOID OBSOLETE WORDS. Obsolete words are words that, once in
good use, have since passed out of general use. This rule might
also be made to include obsolescent words: words that are at present
time passing out of use. Examples of obsolete words:

  methinks            yesterwhiles        twixt
  yclept              afeard              shoon

2. AVOID NEWLY COINED EXPRESSIONS OR NEW USES OF OLD EXPRESSIONS.
There are a great many words current in the newspapers and in other
hasty writing that have not the sanction of general good use at
the present time, though many of these words may in time come into
use. A safe rule is to avoid all words that are at all doubtful.
Examples:

  an invite           an exposé           a try
  enthuse             a combine           fake

A common newspaper fault is the coining of a verb or adjective from
a noun, or a noun from a verb. Examples:

  locomote            suicided            derailment
  pluralized          burglarized         refereed

3. AVOID FOREIGN WORDS. A foreign word should not be used until it
has become naturalized by being in general, reputable use. Since
there are almost always English words just as expressive as the
foreign words, the use of the foreign words usually indicates
affectation on the part of the one using them. Examples:

  billet-doux (love letter)    conversazione (conversation)
  ad nauseam (to disgust)      distingué (distinguished)
  ad infinitum (infinitely)    entre nous (between us)

4. AVOID PROVINCIALISMS. Provincialisms are expressions current
and well understood in one locality, but not current or differently
understood in another locality. Examples:

  guess (think)                reckon (suppose)
  near (stingy)                smart (clever)
  tuckered (tired out)         lift (elevator)
  tote (carry)                 ruination (ruin)

5. AVOID VULGARISMS. Vulgarisms are words whose use shows vulgarity
or ignorance. Such words as the following are always in bad taste:

  chaw                nigger              your'n
  gal                 flustrated          hadn't oughter
  haint               dern                his'n

6. AVOID SLANG. Slang is a form of vulgarism that is very prevalent
in its use even by educated people. Slang words, it is true, sometimes
come into good repute and usage, but the process is slow. The safest
rule is to avoid slang expressions because of their general bad
taste and because of their weakening effect on one's vocabulary
of good words. Examples of slang:

  grind               swipe               booze
  long green          on a toot           dough
  pinch               peach               dukes

7. AVOID CLIPPED OR ABBREVIATED WORDS. The use of such words is
another form of vulgarism. Examples:

  pard (partner)               rep (reputation)
  doc (doctor)                 cal'late (calculate)
  musee (museum)               a comp (complimentary ticket)

8. AVOID TECHNICAL OR PROFESSIONAL WORDS. Such words are usually
clearly understood only by persons of one class or profession.
Examples:

  valence             hagiology           allonge
  kilowatt            sclerosis           estoppel

193. WHEN BARBARISMS MAY BE USED. In the foregoing rules barbarisms
have been treated as at all times to be avoided. This is true of
their use in general composition, and in a measure true of their
use in composition of a special nature. But barbarisms may sometimes
be used properly. Obsolete words would be permissible in poetry
or in historical novels, technical words permissible in technical
writing, and even vulgarisms and provincialisms permissible in
dialect stories.

EXERCISE 76

_Substitute for each of the barbarisms in the following list an
expression that is in good use. When in doubt consult a good
dictionary:_

194. IMPROPRIETIES. The third offense against good use, an impropriety,
is the use of a proper word in an improper sense. In many cases an
offense against good use may be called a barbarism, an impropriety,
or a solecism, since the fields covered by the three terms somewhat
overlap one another. Many improprieties have their origin in the
similarities in sound, spelling or meaning of words. The following
exercises deal with a number of common improprieties resulting
from the confusion of two similar words.

195. IDIOMS. There are in English, as in other languages, a number
of expressions that cannot be justified by the rules of grammar or
rhetoric; and yet these expressions are among the most forcible
ones in the language, and are continually used by the best writers.
These expressions that lie outside all rules we call idioms. Compare
the following idiomatic expressions with the unidiomatic expressions
that succeed them. The second expression in each group is in accord
with the strict rules of composition; but the first, the idiomatic,
is far more forceful.

Idiomatic: The book which I read about.

Unidiomatic: The book about which I read.

Idiomatic: More than one life was lost.

Unidiomatic: More lives than one life were lost.

Idiomatic: Speak loud. Speak louder.

Unidiomatic: Speak loudly. Speak more loudly.

Idiomatic: A ten-foot pole.

Unidiomatic: A ten-feet pole.

Idiomatic: He strove with might and main.

Unidiomatic: He strove with might. (Might and main are two words
of the same meaning.)

Idiomatic: He lectured on every other day.

Unidiomatic: He lectured on one day out of every two.

Idioms are not to be avoided. On the contrary, because they contribute
great ease and force to composition, their use is to be encouraged.
But the distinction between idiomatic and unidiomatic expressions
is a fine one, and rests solely on usage. Care must be taken not
to go beyond the idiomatic. There is probably little danger that
the ordinary writer or speaker will not use idioms enough.

The following expressions are examples of commonly used idioms:

He was standing at the door _in his shirt sleeves_.

I _don't think_ it will rain (I think it will not rain).

She walked out of the room _on her father's arm_.

John was a poor _shot_.

Do you feel _like a little candy_?

See what my foolishness has brought me _to_.

What part of the city will they settle _in_?

What was the house built _for_?

John needs a match to light his pipe _with_.

That is all I ask _for_.

What are you driving _at_?

_Hard put to it._

_By all odds._

_Must needs._

I must _get up_ by noon.

_Get rid of._

_Get used to._

_Never so good._

_Whether or no._

I can't go _either_.

_You forget yourself_ when you speak so harshly.

I can come only _every other_ day.

If the bell rings _answer the door_.

_I take it_ that you will be there too.

_Come and see_ me.

_Try and_ do it.

The thief _took to his heels_.

196. CHOICE OF WORDS. The words in which a thought is expressed may
not offend against good use, and yet still be objectionable because
they do not accurately and appropriately express the thought. One
should choose not merely a word that will approximately express
the thought, but the one word that best expresses it. The following
suggestions are given to aid in the choice of words:

1. CHOOSE SIMPLE ENGLISH WORDS and avoid what is called "fine writing."
Young writers and newspaper writers are greatly given to this offense
of fine or bombastic writing. Examples:

FINE WRITING                            SIMPLE STYLE
Was launched into eternity              Was hanged
Disastrous conflagration                Great fire
Called into requisition the services    Sent for the doctor
  of the family physician
Was accorded an ovation                 Was applauded
Palatial mansion                        Comfortable house
Acute auricular perceptions             Sharp ears
A disciple of Izaak Walton              A fisherman

2. DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC TERMS. In some cases
general words may be used to advantage, but more often specific
words should be used, since they call to the mind a definite image.
Compare these sentences:

The _high color_ of his face showed his embarrassment.

His _crimson_ face showed his embarrassment.

He was a _large_ man.

He was a _fat_ man.

He was a man of _large frame_.

He was a _tall, heavily proportioned_ man.

He was a man _six feet four inches tall_ and _heavy_ in proportion.

It was an _impressive_ building.

It was a building of _impressive size_.

It was a building of _impressive beauty_.

His _fault_ was robbery.

His _crime_ was robbery.

3. AVOID OVER-STATEMENT OF FACTS. The use of words that are too
strong is a fault especially characteristic of Americans. Examples:

Poor: The concert was _simply exquisite_.

Better: The concert was _very good_.

Poor: She was _wild_ over the mistake.

Better: She was _much annoyed_ by the mistake.

4. AVOID HACKNEYED PHRASES; expressions that have been worked to
death. Examples:

His paternal acres.

The infuriated beast.

The gentle zephyrs of springtime.

Was gathered to his fathers.

The blushing bride was led to the hymeneal altar.

Applauded to the echo.

EXERCISE 83

_For each of the following expressions devise the best simple English
expression that you can:_

  1. Individual was precipitated.
  2. Tendered him a banquet.
  3. At the witching hour of midnight.
  4. The devouring element was checked.
  5. Piscatorial sport.
  6. Pedal extremities.

  8. Amid the plaudits of the multitude.

 17. Maternal ancestor.
 18. Shuffled off this mortal coil.
 19. Failed to materialize at the banquet.
 20. Tonsorial artist.
 21. Twirler of the sphere.
 22. Pugilistic encounters.
 23. Performed his matutinal ablutions.
 24. Partook of a magnificent collation.
 25. Solemnized the rites of matrimony.

EXERCISE 84

_In the third paragraph of the selection from Cranford (see §186)
observe the use of the following words: HUMAN, WEAKNESS, HANKS,
TWISTED, ANNOYED, and UNDOING. Study the specific nature of these
words by grouping about each of them other words of somewhat similar
meaning, and then comparing the force of the various words in each
group._

_This sort of exercise may be continued by choosing passages from
any careful writer and studying the words that he has used._

EXERCISE 85

_Substitute for each of the following expressions some expression
that will be less general or less exaggerated:_

  1. She is _nice_ looking.
  2. We had a _perfectly gorgeous_ time.
  3. John is a _professional_ man.
  4. The play was _simply exquisite_.
  5. To hear his voice makes me feel _funny_.
  6. The opposing team was _completely annihilated_.
  7. A _noise_ caught our attention.
  8. His manners are _horrid_.
  9. We had a _great_ time.
 10. Such arrogance is _unendurable_.
 11. That is a _good_ book.

197. HOW TO IMPROVE ONE'S VOCABULARY. The few following suggestions
may be found helpful in the acquiring of a good vocabulary:

1. CULTIVATE THE DICTIONARY HABIT. Learn the meaning, pronunciation,
and spelling of each new word that you meet. Only when these three
things are grasped about each word, does one really know the word.
Some persons have found it an invaluable aid to carry with them a
small note book or card on which they note down to be looked up
at a convenient time words concerning which they are in doubt.

2. IN YOUR WRITING AND SPEAKING USE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE NEW
WORDS THAT YOU ACQUIRE.

3. CONSTRUCT GOOD ENGLISH EXPRESSIONS for all the slang, fine writing,
and hackneyed phrases that you meet, and then use the good expressions
instead of the bad ones.

4. STUDY SYNONYMS; words of similar form and meaning. Only by a
knowledge of synonyms can you express fine shades of meaning. _Crabbe's_
English Synonyms and _Fernald's_ Synonyms and Antonyms are good
books of reference for this purpose. In addition to these books,
lists of synonyms will be found in many books that are designed
for general reference.

5. TRY TO GET THE ONE WORD that will best express the idea.

6. READ GOOD BOOKS and good magazines, and read them carefully.

7. CULTIVATE THE SOCIETY of those who use good language.

EXERCISE 86

_Look up the meaning of each of the words in the following groups of
synonyms. Construct sentences in which each word is used correctly:_

  1. Love, like.
  2. Wit, humor.
  3. Discover, invent.
  4. Observe, watch.
  5. Pride, vanity, conceit.
  6. Proof, evidence, testimony.
  7. Balance, rest, remainder.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
